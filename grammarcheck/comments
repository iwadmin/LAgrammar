We’ve all got things that take batteries. Some of them are well designed, and some of them are not. The worst offenders are electronic toys that take (say) half a dozen AA batteries, all of which must be inserted with the correct orientation– spring side first– and pried out, well, somehow. Rather than risk puncturing your batteries by prying them out with something pointy, just use a magnet to lift them out.

Not in all cases. Children are supposed to study and play in  this age and not work. And  they might not be treated nicely or talked to cruelly ... I strongly believe that  children who work more do not enjoy greater freedom instead they feel more tired.

A magnet in its simplest form, is a material that generates a magnetic field. The magnetic field is produced from the magnets’ goal to find the easiest (shortest) route from the North Pole to the South Pole, and vise versa. The magnetic field of a magnet can not be seen but is the reason for the ‘pulling force’ to other magnets and ferrous materials. A larger magnet will inevitably have a larger magnetic field and will attract objects from further way. There are many different types of magnets but Alnico is the preferred choice in schools for easy handling and much less risk than Neodymium, which is much more powerful
it awasome
Silk, steel, cotton
Magnets have invisible magnetic fields which attract and stick onto steel items

Of course not. Just take look on Indians and visit America to see Americans you will know that there is a huge difference between Indians and Americans, their clothing and our , their food an our, their houses and our, their festivals and our, their facilities and our, their national festivals and our, their occasions and our, their rights and our, their duties and our and many more differences between them and us.... You will find these differences in every country. Where the nation or religion gets different automatically people gets different. You are what and your neighbours are what? If you get the answer you will also get that their is some difference between you and your neighbour. So I can proof that there is any and any difference between any two people in any type.

at the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide plant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Over 500,000 people were exposed to methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas and other chemicals. The toxic substance made its way in and around the shanty towns located near the plant.[2] Estimates vary on the death toll. The official immediate death toll was 2,259. The government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release.[3] Others estimate 8,000 died within two weeks and another 8,000 or more have since died from gas-related diseases.[4][5][6] A government affidavit in 2006 stated the leak caused 558,125 injuries including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries.[7]

The Rigveda is a sacred Indo-Aryan collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns still being used in India. It is counted among the four canonical sacred texts of Hinduism known as the Vedas. It is one of the oldest extant texts in any Indo-European language. Philological and linguistic evidence indicate that the Rigveda was composed in the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent, most likely between c. 1500–1200 BCE, though a wider approximation of c. 1700–1100 BCE has also been given.

His investigations showed that, in the entire range of response phenomena (regardless of whether the subject is metallic, plant or animal in origin) there is no breach of continuity; that "the living response in all its diverse modifications is only a repetition of responses seen in the inorganic" and that the phenomena of response "are determined, not by the play of an unknowable and arbitrary vital force, but by the working of laws that know no change, acting equally and uniformly throughout the organic and inorganic matter.

children are the nation's future.if they don't study, our country can't progress.it is necessary for children to study and parents to support them by trying their best to provide them with education.the government should take steps and provide jobs to such parents
children who work are smarter by some criteria while  school-going kids are smarter in the other way.children who work,have experience about each and every good or bad thing of the world,if they can be provided with education too than they can shine.if  school-going kids are given experience they too will shine.
All children had important to study ,when the poor parents are give admission in schools then they are family good and great future.
We the children's  produce better result's through this learning system.
I think that this is the most powerful technique to learn about our studies.
I am very much happy with this site I don't care about others that what do they think.

india is rooted to cultures but now it is changing, it is developing.it does have cultre but ,culture that should be followed.ther is still a mark of backwardness in india but it is still progressing
we should continue our cultures,but it should be to a limit.we should appreciate the work of our astrologers rather than sadhu's or pujari's
i agree with it as nobody has everything there are only somethings that a person can have.

agree because to make this world a better place to live efforts should be made by children to keep their surroundings clean. They should help in household work to be independent and save parent's time which they can utilize with their children."
No, I don't think so as nowadays, education s a major issue and only educated children lead good lives and get good jobs. The children who do not go to school show stubbornness and laziness. These children do not remain happy throughout their lives. I feel that schools are a necessity.
No,children who can't go or do not go to school are not happier as they are missing their childhood's most interesting  and important phase of life .Studies would help them in their future for getting a good job and make good money .It is fun to go to school as we learn important things & make friends,we learn sports and extra curricular activities.I feel all parents should make their best effort to sent their children to the nearby school.

Animals are important for the food chain and ultimately the biosphere. We need the animals to survive not as food but as beings who help us to co-exist in this world..
Scientifically we say that the big bang was the reason that the world came into existence. The big bang theory says that the world was created by the big collision although there are many other theories e.g., Dalvin's theory. Some people who believe in spirituality believe that a supreme power "God" created the whole world.
I don't know if it true but I would like to believe that it is.
A good movie clearly bringing out the quote practice makes a man perfect.
Must read very important notes for teachers and parents...
today is also called as present because we can't change anything in past or the future but we have the ability to change what happens in our today. Whatever happened is past but whatever happens tomorrow is a result of the actions you carry out today.

what is this?
Even when the Djini gave the camel he explained that it is not a punishment that the camel has got his hump rather it is a boon in disguise for the survival.
Have you all wondered what might be an alternative stories to explain how the camel's hump came into existence. Any ideas??
When the world was created each being was created with some strengths and weaknesses of its own so I think when the camel was created he was made that way so that he could survive in the hottest place in the earth, go on days without water. So I think at the time when the camel came into existence he was made with a hump.
Tough indeed. But I Became the CEO!

Adding to this I would like to say that it is better to have tried and failed rather than not trying at all. We succeed only when we attempt.

one of the much discussed and researched comet. Comes every 76 years. I wish I can see it once.
No I think in this age students should go to schools and play and study. In this age it's illegal to work ,who work in this age might not be happy and are unmannered .so I don't think that children who work have more money and enjoy freedom
you are very right
in India, it is illegal to work under the age of 18 years. But since child labour still happens in india, many poor children do work. Their wages are very low and their masters are often strict. Nor do they earn a lot of money and neither do they enjoy freedom.

"I think my three important questions would be...
1. If given a chance to do a makeover again, what would we change in the humans?
2. There is never a right time to do a right thing, we humans believe in living in this motto still we have regrets, why?
3. How do we judge whether a person's intention towards is are good?"
i think we are more rooted and closer to our culture and traditions. India is known all over the world for its diverse and varied cultures. I think we are traditional or modern in our thoughts.
The king needed some answers and he heard that the hermit was very wise therefore he might be able to answer his questions.

Children who work are given money but not enough to sustain and make a world of their own. When we talk about freedom, it means that we are free. But freedom not only means to be free but also to be happy and contended.
Freedom and money are different words with different meanings. I am sure enough to say that the children who works are only given money not freedom or happiness I agree that some children get freedom but majorly the children are not given freedom.
Money and freedom are two words which have different meanings for each person. Also depends on the general background of each child who is working. The situation he is working might be different than what we may perceive. A child who is working to just survive and for the meager meal that he is managing cannot be said to have a sense of freedom. Similarly the idea of freedom has different expressions. The working condition, financial standing of that child is as important as understanding what his work means to him. The age of the child is a major concern pointing to the fact if the child is old enough to understand where and how to use the money. Necessarily it may not be that children who have more money and enjoy freedom because money is not the only source known to experience freedom. There are joys greater than money which children are more prone to experiencing because of their innocence.
Poor children have no right to miss school as they are also humans and have the right to get educated. Government can give worthy children free scholarships to schools. Their parents should be given a job which can help them for their survival.
"Children are the backbone of our society,a very well known saying implies on each citizen of a country. No I oppose the very above statement.Children grow up illiterate because they are working and not attending school.To provide better livelihoods for parents that allow them to send their children to school rather than work.They also should acquire proper education as we do. To have at younger age is the birthright of every children, irrespective of their parents financial status.And if the problem is of the lack of money then the government should look over to this issue. The government should make it illegal and punish the parents who send children to work and employers should be punished too.The government should alleviate poverty. When people or parents are not that poor they won't let their children work just to make ends meet.The government should make education more accessible or if possible free to the poorest of the poor. When people are educated they will value it. 
Government should provide more employment so that parents never send their children to earn money. If they will have enough money why they will send their children to hazardous jobs.
THIS WAY OUR COUNTRY'S LITERACY RATE WOULD INCREASE."
No. Instead they should be given admission either free or the government should pay their fees. And their parents should be given jobs by the government.
Yes, of course. I say we should throw waste food regularly because it may become one time meal for poor.
I indeed agree with this statement. The simple example is that we waste food which is what some people might need the most.
tyjtyjetrhhjuybn hgjtyjgn  nj hngh gjngh nb
In my opinion, No, the children who can't go to school aren't happier than the children who go as they can't enjoy the school life which we do! Children who don't attend school cannot sit at their home and relax, so their parents force them to work. And by working the child cannot enjoy his childhood. Government should take charge and give worthy children free scholarships. By this India's literacy rate will increase.
No, children who cannot afford or do not go to school are not happier than the children who go to school.children who do not go to school work all day either for someone or as ragpickers. They don't get as much happiness as normal school going children get.
"kesha parikh

They are not happy because their circumstances do not allow them to study . if they do not study they will be deprived of good and comfortable life"
Yes as she has been experiencing this from even more than before Velu
I think that given the circumstances Jaya has just learned to survive in the conditions that she is living in. And that is what people might say is brave or smart.
v.GOOD
Children must learn these values so that they are prepared for there future and become better citizens of India.
indeed such values and the understanding of cleanliness should be inculcated in the children at a very young age.
"no,the children who cannot or do not go to school are not happier than those who go because
1. They will have no friends.
2.When they grow up they will have no job.
3 if they don't have job then they will have no money because of which they will have.no house and no proper and clean food
4.And because they will have no access to clean food and water and also if they don't have a house they will be either have sunstroke in summer and will catch cold in winter season and will have no money for medical needs."
No children who cannot  or do not go to school are not happier than those who do go to school because they do not meet friends every day.  They are deprived of education and knowledge. They cannot learn new interesting things as school going children do so.
Speaking for my own self I have never met anyone who does not like going to the school. In the longer run education is definitely much required. Some people are not that blessed to be able to attend schools depending on their situation.
Children are the future of the society. So we need to go ahead and give the proper teaching. Stop not till the goal is achieved.
As we have heard from many people saying that children are the future citizens of our country. We are expected to bring a change in the society. A good change. We have the responsibility of growing into better citizens who are aware of our rights.
YES. I THINK IT IS .
Yes I do think that the story can be true because we see a lot of kids who do not go to schools and are forced to work from a very early age.
I think when Velu met Jaya, because at least he was not alone and was with somebody who did not have bad intentions.
You certainly begin to think as to how many such children are there who live in conditions like Jaya and Velu.
werewfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
The kind of questions that are asked and the answers are so surprising. We should be ashamed and we should do something for the under privileged

I was shocked when I read that most children start earning at the age of 5, its so disturbing.
Its ironic and shocking that a kid who has worked for the chocolate factory has never eaten chocolate even once! People like us are really blessed to have been grown up in such good families.
The number of children is 10.5 million! Its really disheartening to know that they have to work for their square meals and most importantly they are missing out their education.
Oh my god.. I am really disturbed after reading this. It is inhumane of what this kids have faced.
I really feel bad when I read such articles. Let's oppose child labor in every manner we can and make India a child labor free country.
We should do something so strong that can stop and alter the course that child labor has taken in this world.
Must watch... the struggles and the way faith keeps it going.

Interesting... wonder how much thought god would have put in before creating every being!
If the Indian rulers had united , they would have been able to defeat the British ! The sole reason for emergence of British Raj is that , there were many small regions having kings and nawabs , who had internal disputes and differences . Thus small rulers and nawabs were easy to conquer or convince for the British officers and governors .
"Yes , Britishers introduced many new  industrial and social reforms which led to revolution !
They brought in and stared construction of tar roads , railways , etc. 
They also abolished social evils like 'Sati' , 'Doodh-piti' , etc. in rural parts of India !"
"It could be rightly said that India learnt a lot from the British !
Firstly , about the new inventions and new methods of work . Secondly , Britishers brought in a new way of social and political governance which has shaped the present day political and economic scenario of India ! Thirdly , they taught Indians how they should be careful and not give away the whole economy of the country into the hands of foreigners !"
"The advantages were the positive changes brought in by them , like the introduction and showcase of strong managerial skills through which Indians learnt a lot ! Plus their inventions and industrial revolution .
Disadvantages were that they tried to curb the freedom of Indians upon their own lands and goods , and levy high taxes and make profit !"
they were in need of fine quality of products that were only available in India .
"make profit for Britain by making the kings and nawabs understand the economic needs , so that the trade and politics don't get tangled leading to war !
I would try to convince the Indian authorities to levy less tax so that I could earn profit as well as they would not be at loss !"
they suffered from diseases or died in wars !
"now they got many rights and could trade more freely yielding more profit !
Also as now it was a part of government , it could influence nawabs in decision making ."
they wanted cotton , silk , saffron , pepper , cardamom , cinnamon , tea and other such goods which were produced in India and were in a lot of demand in the western countries .
its was an Anglicised version of Nawab !
it was an Anglicised version of Nawab ! They were the British officers who returned to England with a lot of riches and flaunted their wealth !
"Britishers hadn't come to loot India but to increase trade relations with India ! However later when they ruled , a lot of officers became corrupt and stared stealing ! Apart from this the British government also had a greed to extract more and more profits from trade and taxes , for which they started looting riches from Indian lands and export it to Britain !
But initially they came with the purpose of trading !"
"nawabs claimed that the company was depriving Bengal of huge amounts of taxes , writing humiliating letters and disrespecting the nawabs !
On contrary , the company said that nawabs were imposing heavy taxes and not giving them rights to rebuild forts which was ruining the trade !"
This comic book is very good and helps us understand the different situations from Tipu's point of view. All the books from Amar Chitra Katha are great and easy to understand.
Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist and during his reign, the Mughal Empire reached its greatest extent.
very good Tavan. I will recommend next task asap.
THEY HAVE ALSO RIGHTS TO SAVE THEMSELVES.
it was a Sepoy Mutiny!
Aurangzeb was certainly good in expansion, but he made too many enemies and had absolutely no love for his family.
It is a nice video, but the music is distracting
Tipu is seen as a hero in Pakistan as well. There were three ships in the fleet of Pakistan Navy named after Tipu Sultan and hence called PNS Tippu Sultan.
Tipu Sultan was instructed in military tactics by French officers in the employment of his father.
I was not knowing that
The last sword used by Tipu in his last battle, at Sri Rangapatnam, and the ring worn by him were taken by the British forces as war trophies.
Selfless love cannot led anyone to suffer.
Something which is selfless, altruistic or done for others can never involve suffering for others.
we feel a sense of happiness not for ourselves but because we made someone happy. the joy of giving should be experienced by everyone.
without sharing and caring you would not understand the joy of giving. it is equally important to understand that sharing does not make somebody smaller than the others instead it makes you a bigger person.
"Also, when you water, water at the roots, flower keep their mouths where we should wear our boots.
Soak the earth around them, then through all the heat. the flower will have water, for their thirst 'feet'!
-- P.A. Ropes"
Parents are our first teachers. And teachers are our second parents. Both of them have a heavy influence on us therefore they do play an important role in shaping and supporting our dreams
amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! such a small boy playing pool
Hi, Sonali its not true what you have written. Yah its true that you have your own thought but its seriously not true at all.
Parents are our icons. The day-to-day activity which we learn from our parents that frame our future and shape and support our dreams. Teachers are our GURU we should follow them. Teachers would never think bad for us. Therefore our ICONS and our GURUS play an important role in shaping and supporting our dreams.
I think that is she don't want to let that lovely bird out or to lose that bird.
You can be happy when you something but sharing it with your close ones makes you understand the bond of sharing and love.
Cheating is against the moral values that we have grown up with. Cheating may help you in a short term but not for the longer run.
Yes of course . As intelligence is nothing in front of hard work. If you are interested  in giving reply just reply.
Yes it is. If he/she gets an ego of thinking that I am the best of all, that person surely going down in his/ her marks. It is not written anywhere that the person who is intelligent should  get good marks.
I would like to become a psychologist
I think that they were jealous of her. Even though they were hers YOUNGER sisters.
Amazing... just mind blowing. Every child is special.
he would like to be at fields while playing.
I think it was her own insecurity that led her to cage that bird. Moreover she fell in the trap of her sisters' words adding more to her insecurity.
you are right,sonali
I disagree to this point. The princess puts the little bird in for her own selfish desire after listening to her jealous sisters. She started to doubt the little bird and was afraid that her lovable bird will not come back to her anymore.
I think its correct.
I think that more than well wishers they were jealous of her.
it was wrong. she could have thought from the both's point of view, the parrot's and her own point of view. and according to me it's her sisters' mistake. it seemed like they were more of jealous than her parrot.
THATS TRUE .IT IS MUCH BETTER TO WATCH THEIR SWEETNESS ALIVE
Agree. Everybody should agree this. Because if a human tries to do a thing without giving up he/she will success.
"yes. the garden & parks are really  important . we can enjoy fresh  air
outdoor games etc"
Yes of course . the fresh air !!!!! Amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes, Of course. The trees, plants, grass, birds, butterflies are important for us to survive. If any of these cease to exist we will have a tough time surviving or we may not even make it till the end.
that it was a magical place [the place where the giant lived] .
that the Djinn wasn't scary at all, as I've read in some Arabian Nights stories.

When you love someone with whole of your heart you look forward to their happiness before your own. You strive to make them happy and by seeing them happy, you feel elated.
the story of the crafts and industries of India during British rule.
That's true.
I cannot understand what you have written.
I do not agree. Pain can be subdued or killed by painkillers or rubbing that spot. It definately cannot go away by eating good food. If you have braces, the first few days your jaws hurt and there is constant pain. If you eat good food in such a situation, the pain does not decrease at all.(It even slightly increases).
every life has its own value. we can not consider the human as the greatest creature, a human can not do what a sparrow or a rabbit can do, nor they can do what humans can do.
When the princess grew out of the insecurity which was nestling in her mind and she finally freed her little bird.
might be he would have named them as per the days of the week... anyone would like to share their ideas?
I disagree at this point. Because nature is equal with everybody. If why not rabbit or sparrow is there it is meant same for the god.
Every life means the same. It does not mean that because humans have brain or they are large and have machines so they mean a lot to the nature. In the rules of nature, a life is a life may it be a cockroach or a elephant or a human.
Friends are omnipresent. U don't always have to be near them. Distances don't play an important role when you know that you are supported by your friends.
Yes I think that is true. Any matter, big or small can be resolved in a verbal exchange without a fight.
There is always a middle way or a better solution. Where we can we should avoid fighting.
I don't know about creation but whatever is present in the nature belongs to every being who lives in the nature.
Power and stamina can be maintained by good diet and regular exercise but yes you should know the weaknesses of your body and turn them into strength.
Yes I think that is true. My brother is quite skinny and has hardly any muscules but he is very strong and can lift me ( two years elder ) with ease.
All the series of these books are amazing and capture the feelings of an american teen very, very well. They are hilarious and never bore you, even for a second.
I love the way Kinney has handled the satire... Amazing book.
I don't think we can generalize the nature. The ways of dealing with fights surely differ but girls and boys both fight!
I do not agree with this statement. There are sportsmen who are very calm and peaceful.
Sometimes when I see humans being so cruel and heinous I do feel that animals are more sensitive because they do not do something which goes against the nature.
Disagree. Many people buy parrots, cockatoos and galahs because they ‘speak’, and are therefore entertaining. The birds then spend the rest of their lives in a cage, repeating meaningless phrases for the amusement of their ‘owners’.
Its really painful to listen to keep animals or birds to tame them. I am so sorry but I disagree at this point. I don't want to make anyone to setup his/her CIRCUS OF TAME ANIMALS/BIRDS.
We should help our parents.
You are extremly correct.
they grew jealous. "Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn." I think this line explains itself. But the sisters' jealousy made them do lot of immoral things.
I think "The importance of Freedom" would have been an alternate title as well.
INTRESTING MOVIE
Yes, I think that is true. Even you you may not be able to see insects or birds or animals closely, it is much better to see them full of life
This movie deserves all the accolades that it has. Truly amazing.
As Bert and Red has done a good thing we should also help our neighbours when they need.
mast ha arka
if farmers  dont do harvest then people will not get food to eat
you can always have the middle way. the person whom you are fighting with and you can always come half way and find a solution suitable to the both of you.
when they understand each other's weaknesses and decide to help each other out.
Oh I just absolutely love this movie...Me and my cousins used to have a home alone movie marathon! Some of the best memories.

SUPER DUPER BOOK. I THANK DEVDUTT PATTANAIK FOR THE BOOK
YAMUNA THE SACARED RIVER OF INDIA ,ITS BOOK ; FANTASTIC
Nice process for making a Manuscript !!!
god knows what to give and what not,,,god has given mind to everyone, and it depends on us how to use our mind to earn money.....if he would have given as everything.......there might have won't be any difference between animal and human beings.
one of the great classics in the English Literature!
when we play a prank on someone, some people take it sportingly enough and some do not like it at all. Beware on whom you are playing the prank!
frankly speaking I would feel humiliated and embarrassed.
YES, IT IS. BECAUSE WITHOUT KNOWING HISTORY WE CANNOT WORKOUT ANY FUTURE PLANS.
Rivers are important, because they are largest providers of water.
A very good movie about how hard work can always lead you to success. loved the chemistry between Chan and Smith Jr.
really amazing
I cannot understand what is written. Please help me if you can.
I love to visit on riversides. Do you?
SAME WORDS FOR THE COUNTRY
according to me, everything is science. Every action that happens in this world has some or the other logic behind. people who believe in spirituality say that supernatural being or spirits are the beings who are stuck in between life and death. Many people believe that it is the cycle of life making it sound more scientific. So I think that science can explain everything.
a must watch hilarious movies of what kids can do when they have a set agenda! I think there was a Bollywood movie which was inspired by this namely Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi
My cousin who was younger to me took away my book and ran. So i ended up shouting on him only to realize later that he just wanted to grab my attention and play with me he took my book.
This is a great app, I can learn many things from this app.Thanks for this app
they started helping each other and realizing that fight is a waste of time.
when the fight came to an end and they both started helping each other and became friends and were no more thinking themselves as the best and not more bullying on each other.
In the starting only they both would have shared the pool.
Any teenager would like to read and follow the rules which are given above, while an adult will refuse to follow the above rule or might agree also, and child would not understand what is written, in short the full passage given above is only for teenagers and teenagers will best understand the passage even adult can any do the mistake to understand the above passage.
very good and very very nice
chor police develops interest in me also but still i study
Thats not right because then, the lazy will remain lazy and will not learn to work hard. The hard working will become lazy as they know that God will provide. God helps those who help themselves

its very Amazing
This book is about the science behind magnetism It describes force and how magnets attract and repel. It also relates magnetism to the Earth's poles and real life medical science. This book is written in a very child friendly manner so these otherwise complicated topics are easier for young students to understand. I would use this book as an introduction to a magnetism unit. It is a great overview of the basics students need to understand about the topic before experimenting with magnets.
Agreed.............

Cooperatives include non-profit community organizations and businesses that are owned and managed by the people who use its services (a consumer cooperative) or by the people who work there (a worker cooperative) or by the people who live there (a housing cooperative), hybrids such as worker cooperatives that are also consumer cooperatives or credit unions, multi-stakeholder cooperatives such as those that bring together civil society and local actors to deliver community needs, and second and third tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives. The International Co-operative Alliance was the first international association formed by the movement. It includes the World Council of Credit Unions. A second organization was formed later in Germany, the International Raiffeisen Union. In the United States, the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) serves as the sector's oldest national membership association. It is dedicated to ensuring that cooperative businesses have the same opportunities as other businesses operating in the country and that consumers have access to cooperatives in the marketplace. A U.S. National Cooperative Bank was formed in the 1970s. By 2004, a new association focused on worker co-ops was founded, the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives

This was an interesting story
I know & understand about living thing & non living thing
"A very large, powerful brown eagle with golden or tawny tinge over its crown and nape, a square, faintly barred tail, and feathered legs. Large, yellowish black bill with yellow skin at base; brown eyes; yellow legs.

The Golden Eagle breeds in late winter in south, spring to summer in north. They build a large nest of branches and twigs, lined with a leafy twigs, grasses or conifer needles, in a tree or on a cliff or high rock. They add to their nest each year, so it can grow to a huge size. The golden eagle has 1-3 white eggs, which are often spotted or blotched with brown, chestnut, and pale gray, incubated usually by the female for 43-45 days. They are taken care of by the female for the first little while and then male joins in the caretaking."
I agree with the moral and it is very nice
Nice variety of food.
now he had become big hearted
NICE BUT INOMATIONAL
Wow  it's  very  very  Good
The giant fruit bat has a wing span of up to 5 feet (1.5m). It is the largest bat in the world. It has a very keen sense of smell and a very long muzzle. They roost upside down in the trees and wrap their wings around their bodies. Feeding time is at dusk when they set off to eat fruit. They squish fruit in their jaws and drink the juice but let the seeds and the rest of the fruit fall to the ground. The females give birth to one baby at a time. They will carry their baby around with them for two months
so nightmare
the author-illustrator of the LIFE AND TIMES series focuses on the science, uses and history of American’s most prevalent crop. A master of fascinating trivia, he knows just how to draw readers in and expand on a seemingly small topic.

hahahahahahaha................
they are the future of our modern society  & country
children run away from homes because of their parents misdeed
when velu was thinking that he should do not do such a work like rag picking
so lucky
In my opinion, this is a true statement. Our environment influences our thought, clothes and way of life.
THAT THE DJINN TAUGHT THE CAMEL IN A A RIGHT WAY TO DO WORK.
"out Snowy Owl 
The male is a large snow-white owl with brownish bars and spots near tips of feathers on wings and tail; underparts faintly barred with very pale brown. The female has much heavier, darker bars and spots. Legs and feet heavily feathered. Blackish-brown bill; yellow eyes.

The female makes the nest in the spring by making a scrape on the ground among mosses or stones, sometimes it will be lined with moss and feathers. The female will lay 4-10 white eggs, depending on how much prey there is. The female will incubate the eggs for 32-37 days. The chicks are taken care of by the female at first while the male brings food. 

This owl is insulated from the cold by its thick plumage and feathered feet. The snowy owl will spend all year hunting on the icy tundra of the high Arctic. In the summer it will hunt 24 hours a day by sight as there is little to no nighttime. It will perch on rocks or other high spots looking for prey. In the darkness of the Arctic, it relies on its ears to hear lemmings scurrying through their runs under the snow. Lemmings are their main prey. When the lemming population rises, snowy owls make the most of this by laying extra large clutches of eggs, and rearing as many young as they can. But these booms are followed by population crashes, and the snowy owls scatter across the tundra, sometimes even leaving the tundra altogether during the winter months."
NOT EXACTLY
THIS STORY SHOWS THE MORAL THAT EVERY PERSON HAS TO WORK FOR HIS OWN.
IT is good.
I AGREE WITH THIS TO WORK, BUT TO WORK MORE IS ALSO DANGEROUS.
AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO MAN ON EARTH, FIRST THERE IS ONLY VEGETATION, THEN CAME UP ANIMALS AND INSECTS. THEN AFTERS CAME THE MAN.

"I think hunting should be banned as a sport. In the normal ecosystems, the food web is balanced. Every one knows how much they can have and how much they are allowed to keep. Human do not follow these rules. There greed drives them for more and more, put the different animal species in danger. The normal ecosystem keeps species from overpopulating, but humans makes species extinct. 

Hunting for mass production is bad enough, do we really need to endanger the animals more by hunting for a sport?"
very nice fact to be known by me

osom
i don't thing so because if they need to work so much and then also get a little amount food or left food this is not good because we are not working such as this jaya and the boy but we are getting the proper freadom . one thing i should tell to those children who work for money is try to save money as much as you can and use that money in some imergences.
i dont thing this is right becaue as we say in hindi childrens are the god  , so iwould say this age this children is to study and give a better life to their children that they would work like them.
this thing i agree because if help in cleaning our enviroment than we are ganing a skill of healping and having neatness in our life and as we know that we should help our brothers, sisters,mother , father etc because it make a good impresion in their heart and gain a skill of helping other.
stone nowadays is used to hit our enemy"s head.........do you agree

"Regulation
The private sector is legally regulated by the state. Businesses within one country are required to comply with the laws in that country.

In some cases, usually involving multinational businesses that can pick and choose their suppliers and locations based on their perception of the regulatory environment, these regulations have resulted in uneven practices within one company. For example, workers in one country may benefit from strong labour unions, while workers in another country have very weak laws supporting labour unions, even though they work for the same employer. In some cases, industries and individual businesses have chosen to self-regulate by applying higher standards for dealing with their workers, customers, or the environment than the minimum that is legally required of them."
Growth of flower
no all plants and animals are not ediable
"Photosynthesis is one of the most important processes on earth. Because of its giving energy to the plant, it indirectly also gives us energy. We eat plants, so get the energy stored by photosynthesis. Even meat eaters get their energy from plants as animals also eat plants. 
These cycles are called food chains. A food chain starts with a plant (a producer) continues with herbivores and carnivores (consumers) and ends with an organism like a vulture  (decomposer). The very last item of a food chain is a bacteria that breaks down dead organisms into useful nutrients for the soil, which is in turn used by plants.
A connection of food chains is called a food web. The whole world is one big food web."
Can't understand anything
where is Aral?
A waterless, desolate area of land with little or no vegetation is a desert. And Antarctica has scanty vegetation and is almost covered with snow . It is a polar Desert. For the picture of antarctica , go to "http://i1.wp.com/lima.nasa.gov/img/beardmoreglacier.jpg".

Japanese is written in a combination of three scripts: hiragana, katakana, and kanji. Kanji represents ideas or objects, hiragana expresses the grammatical relationships between them. Katakana is used for words of foreign origin. Like romaji, both hiragana and katakana characters represent one syllable and have no meaning other than the representation of sound. Though Japanese is usually written in a combination of three scripts, Japanese sentences can be written in either hiragana or katakana only. I think learning hiragana and katakana is a good start for Japanese writing.

Fortunately, this year's rookie crop is among the strongest ever - and Gulliver Curry's one of the best. He's also a walking contradiction, a hotshot firefighter with a big vocabulary and a winter job at a kid's arcade. He came to Missoula to follow in the footsteps of Lucas "Iron Man" Tripp, yet he's instantly more fascinated by his hero's daughter. Rowan, as a rule, doesn't hook up with other smoke jumpers, but Gull is convinced he can change her mind. And damn if he doesn't make a good case to be an exception to the rule
funny funny

Now a days global warming is increasing instantly and also amount of CFC has increased , all this have started harming the environment to vast extent thus , sustainable development is must now...

Handle the cutting responsibilities to avoid injuries in younger children
"THERE R WOMEN IN COORPORATIVE Since cooperatives are based on values like self-help, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity, they can play a particularly strong role in empowering women, especially in developing countries.Cooperatives allow women who might have been isolated and working individually to band together and create economies of scale as well as increase their own bargaining power in the market. In statements in advance of International Women's Day in early 2013, President of the International Cooperative Alliance, Dame Pauline Green, said, ""Cooperative businesses have done so much to help women onto the ladder of economic activity. With that comes community respect, political legitimacy and influence.""

However, despite the supposed democratic structure of cooperatives and the values and benefits shared by members, due to gender norms on the traditional role of women, and other instilled cultural practices that sidestep attempted legal protections, women suffer a disproportionately low representation in cooperative membership around the world. Representation of women through active membership (showing up to meetings and voting), as well as in leadership and managerial positions is even lower."

I agree with this statement
all British were not wrong because the British like Dalhouse and Wellesly were doing a great like they were broking the laws like Sati system, child marriage, widow marriages and developing the railways system, telegraph system, post system and etc.
No , I don't agree ; because like Clive , all the officers weren't corrupt and dishonest . Many of them came from came from poor backgrounds and there main motive was to earn a lot and get back to Britain and have a leisurely life !
Are you sure? This should be made applicable to other states also. There will be less of Litter
No , the British came to India as traders . They came India in search of fine Indian products like cotton , silk and condiments ; because they faced problem in acquiring these products at a cheaper rates and managing land , offices and relations with Nawabs or Kings of different regions , they took up war fray to have a strong hold on trade activities .

"weed-choked, garbage-strewn abandoned lot next door. She closed her eyes and pictured heirloom tomatoes, a beehive, and a chicken coop.

What started out as a few egg-laying chickens led to turkeys, geese, and ducks. Soon, some rabbits joined the fun, then two three-hundred-pound pigs. And no, these charming and eccentric animals weren't pets; she was a farmer, not a zookeeper. Novella was raising these animals for dinner. Novella Carpenter's corner of downtown Oakland is populated by unforgettable characters. Lana (anal spelled backward, she reminds us) runs a speakeasy across the street and refuses to hurt even a fly, let alone condone raising turkeys for Thanksgiving. Bobby, the homeless man who collects cars and car parts just outside the farm, is an invaluable neighborhood concierge. The turkeys, Harold and Maude, tend to escape on a daily basis to cavort with the prostitutes hanging around just off the highway nearby. Every day on this strange and beautiful farm, urban meets rural in the most surprising ways.

For anyone who has ever grown herbs on their windowsill, tomatoes on their fire escape, or obsessed over the offerings at the local farmers' market, Carpenter's story will capture your heart. And if you've ever considered leaving it all behind to become a farmer outside the city limits, or looked at the abandoned lot next door with a gleam in your eye, consider this both a cautionary tale and a full-throated call to action. Farm City is an unforgettably charming memoir, full of hilarious moments, fascinating farmers' tips, and a great deal of heart. It is also a moving meditation on urban life versus the natural world and what we have given up to live the way we d"

her opening remarks at the working session on women on Day 2 of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2007 in New Delhi that "the Constitution of India provides for equality of opportunities for men and women. Portraying the stark rights denial that women face in the country and referring to some 2004 statistics, she said that a woman was raped every 29 minutes and molested every 15 minutes. Talking about sinful acts like female feticide, Ms Aga said Indian women are deprived and discriminated. This, if continued, would lead to a situation, 20 years from now, when the sex ratio would be 80:20 (male: female).
no constitution provides all types of equality. it is under the constitution law which is made by government for peoples profit.

and Medicine. Our topic was whether income inequality is a health risk to people who live in particularly unequal cities or states. The idea is that income inequality is like a toxic pollution, harming everyone who lives with it. My own view, then and now, is that there is no such effect, though I also believe that the extreme income inequality that we see in the U.S. today is a threat to public health, but through quite different (essentially political) mechanisms. - See more at: http://healthblog.ncpa.org/does-inequality-cause-poor-health/#sthash.rqMwSg62.dpuf
"Last year, I took up the hobby of birding or birdwatching after my friend took me out to observe some birds out near the lake. Basically, birding involves observing birds in their natural habitat. (Actually, you don't need to leave your backyard to observe many birds.)

The best seasons to watch birds are in the spring and fall as they migrate from north to south in many areas. I usually go out with my binoculars and a field guidebook in the mornings because most birds are very active and feed at that time. You also have to know where to look to see them and how to recognize their bird calls. Because I'm new to birding, I consult my bird guidebook to look up specific varieties of birds. You have to look carefully at their plumage (feathers), the way they behave and move, and their size to recognize many birds because some look very similar"
"THERE once lived a bird and her two new-born babies in a
forest. They had a nest in a tall, shady tree and there the
mother bird took care of her little ones day and night.
One day, there was a big storm. There was thunder,
lightning and rain, and the wind blew down many trees. The
tall tree in which the birds lived also came down. A big, heavy
branch hit the nest and killed the bird. Fortunately for the
baby birds, the strong wind blew them away to the other side
of the forest. One of them came down near a cave where a
gang of robbers lived. The other landed outside a rishi’s
ashram a little distance away."

"Animal Encyclopedia is the most comprehensive on the market today, amazing and entertaining readers, while providing them with authoritative information about the animal kingdom. Kids love to look at animals and this book showcases more than 1,000 gorgeous color photographs as only National Geographic--the leader in wildlife photography--can. Thematic spreads take readers through animal homes and habitats, senses and communication, life cycle and babies, movement and migration, defenses, camouflage, and adaptation, and endangered animals and conservation. Special features in each section include ANIMAL PROFILES spreads that focus in-depth on a particular animal and ANIMAL RECORDS spreads that highlight superlatives such as fastest, tallest, smallest, etc. Exclusive FROM-THE-FIELD reports, that focus on National Geographic explorers and their stories about the animals they study, can only be found in this animal encyclopedia, adding to its entertainment and educational value.

Animals are organized by taxonomy within each section (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates), accompanied by common and scientific name, fact boxes (featuring lifespan, habitat, and size) and text describing diet, special features, and any other pertinent information. Symbols representing conservation and habitat status highlight a high-interest topic for kids, while color-coding on each section provides for ease of navigation. Backmatter will include a listing of animal species along with basic information including name (scientific and common), lifespan, diet, size, and habitat. A comprehensive glossary, index, and ""find out more"" section round out this must-have resource"

Many people are familiar with the most common and popular types of pet birds, such as Budgies, Finches, and Cockatiels -- but finding those who can list some of the more uncommon species that are sometimes kept as pets can be a challenge. Whether you are researching more exotic species in the hopes of adopting a unique pet or you are just curious, you can find out more about some of the most uncommon pet birds in the world in the information below.

"Frederick Sewards Trueman [6th February 1931 - 1st July 2006]

John Arlott, the poetic cricket commentator, raconteur and wine enthusiast from Hampshire, wrote that Trueman approached the wicket 'with the majestic rhythm that emerges as a surprise in the Spanish fighting bull'.  Beginning at a steady pad, he gradually accelerated, hair flopping, until he completed his charge in an explosion of malevolent power.

Trueman rounded off this spectacle with histrionic gestures of despair, rage or triumph.

Arguably the finest fast bowler that England [and of course Yorkshire] has produced, Freddie Trueman's ability did not end there say Will and Guy.  He was a splendid story teller and would regale audiences with his ""cricketing tales"".Frederick Sewards Trueman [6th February 1931 - 1st July 2006]

Origami is the art of folding paper into a shape representing an object. There are many folding techniques that you need to learn to form a shape out of a piece of paper. Two most important techniques are valley-fold and mountain-fold. At least, you must know what they are and you will have no problem of folding a simple origami model by using only these two folding techniques

"It could be rightly said that ancient colonialism led to modern globalisation to a very large extent ! 
People came to know about different countries , cultures , their products that were produced by them . People became aware about different kind of usage of products and services carried out by different countries ; this is one of the most conducive factor of Globalisation !"
"Britishers hadn't come to loot India but to increase trade relations with India ! However later when they ruled , a lot of officers became corrupt and stared stealing ! Apart from this the British government also had a greed to extract more and more profits from trade and taxes , for which they started looting riches from Indian lands and export it to Britain ! But initially they came with the purpose of trading !

I agree. If more rulers had joined Tipu Sultan, he may have succeeded in driving the British away from India. But if that had happened, then India would still have small kingdoms and somebody else would have come to conquer India with 'Divide and Rule'.
Nawabs claimed that the company was depriving Bengal of huge amounts of taxes , writing humiliating letters and disrespecting the Nawabs ! On contrary , the company said that nawabs were imposing heavy taxes and not giving them rights to rebuild forts which was ruining the trade
or imperialism, began in the 15th century with the "Age of Discovery", led by Portuguese and Spanish exploration of the Americas, and the coasts of Africa, the Middle East, India, and East Asia. During the 16th and 17th centuries, England, France and the Dutch Republic established their own overseas empires, in direct competition with each other. The end of the 18th and early 19th century saw the first era of decolonization, when most of the European colonies in the Americas gained their independence from their respective metropoles. Spain was irreversibly weakened after the loss of their New World colonies, but the Kingdom of Great Britain (uniting Scotland with England and Wales), France, Portugal, and the Dutch turned their attention to the Old World, particularly South Africa, India, and South East Asia, where coastal enclaves had already been established. The industrialization of the 19th century led to what has been termed the era of New Imperialism, when the pace of colonization rapidly accelerated, the height of which was the Scramble for Africa, in which Belgium was a major and Germany a lesser participant. During the 20th century, the overseas colonies of the losers of World War I were distributed amongst the victors as mandates, but it was not until the end of World War II that the second phase of decolonization began in earnest. In 1999, Portugal gave up the last of Europe's colonies in Asia, Macau, to China, ending an era that had lasted six hundred years.

Magnets have long fascinated humans because of their ability to manipulate the world around them invisibly. Because magnets are naturally occurring, their presence has touched many different cultures. It’s difficult to know precisely who discovered magnets. While most cultures have legends about who discovered magnets, it is likely that these tales are nothing more than myth. For example, the story of Magnes of Crete states that he discovered magnets through the use of his iron crook. Another myth places magnetic discovery firmly in the hands of the Greeks. These magnet myths serve to prove that magnets have long been part of the human experience.
Awesome very old photo of making magnet.
Do you mean someone named Magnus discovered Magnets?
Really its true
Hi Priyank, did you read the article above? I found a lot of interesting information about the discovery of magnets in it. You are right that a lot of people believe that Greeks discovered magnets but the article also suggest that magnets (lodestone) were also used in Ancient India by  physicians for surgery too and it was believed to have magical powers.
but who did really discovered it ???????

The back stage of the revolt goes back half a century[1] when the indigo plantation act was established. In February–March 1859 the farmers refused to sow a single seedling of indigo plant. The strength of the farmers' resolutions were dramatically stronger than anticipated from a community victimized by brutal treatment for about half a century. Most importantly it was a revolt of both the major religious groups of farmers in Bengal, notably a farmer Haji Molla of Chandpore (Thana - Hardi)[2] said that he would "rather beg than sow indigo".[3] The farmers were in no possession of any types of arms, it was totally a nonviolent resistance
Opium (poppy tears, lachryma papaveris) is the dried latex obtained from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). Opium contains approximately 12% of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use and for the illegal drug trade. The latex also contains the closely related opiates codeine and thebaine and non-analgesic alkaloids such as papaverine and noscapine. The traditional, labor-intensive, method of obtaining the latex is to scratch ("score") the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off, and dehydrated. The word "meconium" (derived from the Greek for "opium-like", but now used to refer to infant stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the poppy or different species of poppies
nice book to read
"Globalisation widens the horizons of thinking . People get to know about the diverse patterns of living ! They get a chance to adopt the varied kind of living if it is more suitable and learn more and exchange ideas and thoughts , products and services !
But many a times it leads to a very cut throat competitive environment which isn't harmonious ! It also cause many types of pollution like air , soil , water , noise , etc. ."

agriculture is very important.In India it is needed because of poor people who dot get food to eat.
In state of Gujrat agriculture is done on different landforms such as hillslopes (where crop- maize, that do not need stagnated water), on flat-rolling topography (groundnut in Saurashtra),along flood plains and river channels (vegetables, fruits).All these landforms have characteristic sedement and soil.
slash and burn is a type of shifting agriculture in which all the trees are cut down and they cultivate on that land. after 2-3 year after the land loses its fertility, the agriculturalist leave the soil as it is.......environmentalists are trying to stop this........

These chlorine radicals break off an oxygen atom from the ozone molecule, creating an oxygen molecule (O2) and a hypochloryl radical (ClO·). The hypochloryl radical then reacts with an atomic oxygen creating another oxygen molecule and another chlorine radical, thereby preventing the reaction of mono-atomic oxygen with O2 to create natural ozone.

Amphibians are animals that live part of their lives in water and part on land.  They usually have soft, moist skin that is protected by a slippery layer of mucus. They also tend to live in moist places or near water to keep their bodies from drying out. There are three main groups of amphibians: caecilians; salamanders, newts, and mudpuppies; and frogs and toads.

Hi Steve!!  Depend on their composition and how well bonded the components are. More quartz usually means harder. Sediments cemented with silica are usually harder than those cemented with carbonate. If sediments are heated after deposition they get harder (metamorphism). Chert (very fine silica) is one of the hardest sediments.

Elias Stadiatis was the first to lay eyes on a shipwreck 45 meters down, who quickly signaled to be pulled to the surface. He described the scene as a heap of rotting corpses and horses lying on the sea bed. Thinking the diver was drunk from the nitrogen in his breathing mix at that depth, Kondos himself dove, soon returning with the arm of a bronze statue. While waiting for the storm to abate the divers retrieved as many small artifacts from the wreck as they could.

The world's smallest man has met the world's tallest man for the first time.

At 8ft 3in, it was a new high for Sultan Kösen to meet the world's shortest living man Chandra Bahadur Dangi at an event in London.

It is the first time the pair have met and their encounter in the UK marked the Guinness World Records Day.

At just the same size as six stacked cans of baked beans, measuring 1ft 7in, Chandra was discovered in Nepal two years ago at the age of 75.

Despite other short men taking the title, he is one of the shortest ever known."

Turkmenistan was ruled by President for Life Saparmurat Niyazov (called "Türkmenbaşy", "Leader of the Turkmens") until his sudden death on 21 December 2006. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow was elected the new president on 11 February 2007. According to Human Rights Watch, "Turkmenistan remains one of the world’s most repressive countries. The country is virtually closed to independent scrutiny, media and religious freedoms are subject to draconian restrictions, and human rights defenders and other activists face the constant threat of government reprisal." President Berdymukhamedov promotes a personality cult in which he, his relatives, and associates enjoy unlimited power and total control over all aspects of public life.

Once part of the Turkic Khaganate and later Timurid Empires, the region that today includes the Republic of Uzbekistan was conquered in the early 16th century Eastern Turkic-speaking nomads. The area was gradually incorporated into the Russian Empire during the 19th century, and in 1924 what is now Uzbekistan became a bordered constituent republic of the Soviet Union, known as the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (Uzbek SSR). Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, it declared independence as the Republic of Uzbekistan on 31 August 1991 (officially celebrated the following day).

There are many different animal classes and every animal in the world belongs to one of them.  The five most well known classes of vertebrates (animals with backbones) are mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians.  They are all part of the phylum chordata -- I remember "chordata" by thinking of spinal chord.

animals are pride of the forest we should always save them and they are also an important resources
Animals too are classified in a variety of ways. This helps scientists to study the relationships in animal groups and to see the whole animal family tree as it has developed through time. Animals are found everywhere. We give names to each kind and we divide them into groups. Animals that have backbones are called vertebrates. We divide these animals into five groups: amphibians, birds, fish, mammals, and reptiles. Have you ever asked "What makes a bird a bird, or a reptile a reptile?
"Actually the king is really confused a lot now.
By seeing twins birds at two different places."
It happened bad with the king,but from one side it was the lesson for that hunter&selfish king.

With 20 million hectares of forest area, the Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian part of the Barents region accounts for approximately 14 percent of the total forest area of the EU. The forest area in the Swedish parts of the Barents region amounts to about 10 million hectares, which corresponds to a third of the Swedish forest area. Growing stock on forest area accounts for 590 million m3, which is 20 percent of the Swedish total. The forestry industry has opportunities to increase wood production significantly by the use of fertilization.
Industry-based resource surveys have evolved through efforts by scientists and industry members to complement federal trawl surveys by increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of sampling events, particularly in near-shore areas and for individual species of interest. Additional benefits of industry-based surveys include establishing productive working relationships between scientists, managers, and industry members.

The dynasty was established by Pusyamitra Sunga, after the fall of the Maurya Empire. Its capital was Pataliputra, but later emperors such as Bhagabhadra also held court at Besnagar, modern Vidisha in Eastern Malwa.
The Kanva or Kanvayana Dynasty replaced the Sunga dynasty in Magadha, and ruled in the Eastern part of India from 75 BCE to 30 BCE.
The Vākāṭakas, like many coeval dynasties of the Deccan, claimed Buddhist origin. Little is known about Vindhyaśakti (c. 250–270 CE), the founder of the family.

A power-hungry warrior and a peace -loving-wife-could they ever tread together on the path of non-violence? Ashoka waged war after ruthless war, yet by the time his children grew up, he proudly saw them off as Buddhist missionaries. Read about the charmed life of this famous king of Magadha, who not only built a properous kingdom but spread the message of universal love.
"during the Industrial Revolution, upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies. This occurred through many successive rapid advances in technology, such as the production of steel and coal.

Following the Industrial Revolution, perhaps a third of the world's economic output is derived from manufacturing industries. Many developed countries and many developing/semi-developed countries (People's Republic of China, India etc.) depend significantly on manufacturing industry. Industries, the countries they reside in, and the economies of those countries are interlinked in a complex web of interdependence."

Agriculture was the main stay of Indian economy. Nearly eighty percent people adopted cultivation either as principal or as secondary occupation. About seventy percent of national income came from agricultural sector. Agricultural productions constituted mainly food-grains and such other crops like oilseeds, fiber crops, sugar cane required for domestic consumption. Moreover, agriculture had special importance in self-sufficient village economy. However, the British Rule changed the nature and structure of Indian economy.

AT LAST HE FOUND IT.
"The black A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that no particle or light ray entering that region can ever escape from it.[1] The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole.[2] The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although crossing the event horizon has enormous effect on the fate of the object crossing it, it appears to have no locally detectable features. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[3][4] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it all but impossible to observe.

Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in 1958. Long considered a mathematical curiosity, it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed black holes were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality.

Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.

Despite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as light. Matter falling onto a black hole can form an accretion disk heated by friction, forming some of the brightest objects in the universe. If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbit can be used to determine its mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives (such as neutron stars). In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems, and established that the core of the Milky Way contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million M☉."

Icelandic seaman. The local reverend surmises that Lee is God's way of showing "that He's got himself an Almighty sense of humor," but Lee's strange appearance is just one of the ways in which he fails to conform to the world around him. For Lee has a gift of hearing other people's thoughts that also sets him apart -- and gets him into plenty of trouble when he repeats those thoughts aloud. Lee's confounding presence causes ripples of tension everywhere he goes: Where should he go to school? Where should he sit on the bus? And whom is he supposed to date? It even leads to a run-in with Klan members that will set Lee on a course that leads to undreamed-of challenges

yes. I heartily agree with this statement. We study chapters and forget about it but life lessons are learnt in a way that you will remember it for the rest of your life. When something bad happens to us we often question as to "Why me?" but later do we realize that the thing had happened for the bigger cause and that was to give us a lesson. But also let us clear the fact that learning lessons the hard way does not mean that they are punishments. When God takes away something, he is merely emptying our hands to receive something much more valuable.

export trade in Lancashire goods, and subsequent deindustrialization of the Indian subcontinent, are merely the best known. These episodes, although of great importance, far from exhaust the story of cotton. They are well known because of the enormous research energy that has been devoted to them, but other important elements of cotton's long history are deserving of similar attention. The purpose of this collection of essays is to examine the history of cotton textiles at a global level over the period 1200-1850. This volume sheds light on new answers to two questions: what is it about cotton that made it the paradigmatic first global commodity? And second, why did cotton industries in different parts of the world follow different paths of development? Essays included in the volume are authored by 19 scholars from eight different nations, all of whom are specialists in the study of textiles. They are drawn from a range of sub-disciplines within history and bring together their areas and periods of specialization to provide a global history.

"The food that NASA's early astronauts had to eat in space is a testament to their fortitude. John Glenn, America's first man to eat anything in the near-weightless environment of Earth orbit, found the task of eating fairly easy, but found the menu to be limited. Other Mercury astronauts had to endure bite-sized cubes, freezedried powders, and semiliquids stuffed in aluminum tubes. Most agreed the foods were unappetizing and disliked squeezing the tubes. Moreover, freeze-dried foods were hard to rehydrate and crumbs had to be prevented from fouling instruments.

The astronauts complained and on the Gemini missions eating improved somewhat. The first things to go were the squeeze tubes. Bite-sized cubes were coated with gelatin to reduce crumbling, and the freeze-dried foods were encased in a special plastic container to make reconstituting easier. With improved packaging came improved food quality and menus. Gemini astronauts had such food choices as shrimp cocktail, chicken and vegetables, butterscotch pudding, and apple sauce, and were able to select meal combinations themselves.

By the time of the Apollo program, the quality and variety of food increased even further. Apollo astronauts were first to have hot water, which made rehydrating foods easier and improved the food's taste. These astronauts were also the first to use the ""spoon bowl,"" a plastic container that could be opened and its contents eaten with a spoon.

The task of eating in space got a big boost in Skylab. Unlike previous space vehicles for astronauts, Skylab featured a large interior area where space was available for a dining room and table. Eating for Skylab's three-member teams was a fairly normal operation: footholds allowed them to situate themselves around the table and ""sit"" to eat. Added to the conventional knife, fork, and spoon was a pair of scissors for cutting open plastic seals. Because Skylab was relatively large and had ample storage area, it could feature an extensive menu: 72 different food items. It also had a freezer and refrigerator, a convenience no other vehicle offered."

"Hunting might have been necessary for human survival in prehistoric times, but today most hunters stalk and kill animals merely for the thrill of it, not out of necessity. This unnecessary, violent form of “entertainment” rips animal families apart and leaves countless animals orphaned or badly injured when hunters miss their targets.

"Penguins evolved in the Southern Hemisphere taking advantage of the very rich fish stocks in the cold currents of the Southern Ocean.  They need to have plentiful supplies of fish to survive and the conditions for large schools of fish and crustaceans only occur in cold waters.  So although the conditions are suitable both in the Northern and Southern Polar regions, the penguins have never managed to cross into the cold Northern waters.  Penguins can be found anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere where there are cold ocean currents.  The most northerly penguins are found on the equator in the Galapagos Islands.  The Humboldt Current carries cold Antarctic waters right up the coast of South America to the equator and provides sufficiently rich fishing grounds for the penguins.  However, to cross the much warmer tropical waters to reach the cold northern waters which only extend down to Northern Europe, Russia and Canada, has proved to be too great a journey for the penguins.  The Auks occupy a similar ecological niche in these Northern waters.

"Planets are among the many worlds and smaller objects that orbit the Sun. The formal definition of planet, as voted on by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, is as follows:

A planet is a celestial body that
(a) is in orbit around the Sun,
(b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and
(c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit."
The answer to this question is a highly controversial one. This has not always been the case, though. In fact, before 1978 the definition of a "planet" was not really necessary. Until that time a planet simply meant a body in orbit around the Sun, that reflected sunlight, and was not a planetary moon, asteroid, or comet.
It was once filled with mansions of nobles and members of the royal court, along with elegant mosques and gardens. Today, despite having become extremely crowded and dilapidated, it still serves as the symbolic heart of metropolitan Delhi

Very useful
Stars have their own heat and light but planet reflected from it's light.our sun is also a star.our universe is 100 million years ago.black hole What is a black hole?It is a hole in which any of the planet or a star comes in its atmosphere then it gravitational force take it inside it and they are black because they do not have their own light and I don't think that this are too explored questions.
"A star have its own heat and light
A planet drives its heat from star"

"climate and environment, this timely book offers an intriguing glimpse of what the real legacy of our time on the planet may be.

How would the natural world respond if it were suddenly relieved of the burden of humanity? Would the climate return to where it was before we fired up our engines? Could nature ever obliterate all traces of human civilization? How would it undo our largest buildings and public works, and could it reduce our myriad plastics and synthetics to benign, basic elements? And what about architecture and art? What will be our most enduring legacy?

This ground-breaking book examines areas of the world that have been abandoned or never occupied by humans to see how they have fared without us and looks beyond to discover whether, and for how long, our largest cities, biggest achievements and most devastating mistakes will last after we are gone. In doing so it wrestles with some of the key concerns of our time and reveals a picture of the future that is both illuminating and terrifying"

Faith is the greatest helping hand.If we know that someone has faith in us,we know that there is someone to believe in us and be by our side when we need them.
it helped alot
Some authors have said that faith is something which is stronger than fear. It is what keeps us going when nothing else can. It gives us the strength to believe where others lose hope.
may be yes because our scripturous books holds many secrets which may help us fight the natures fury

Bend 6 pieces of wire into leg shapes and insert 3 into each side of the fly's body. Insert the wire antennae into the head and add the clay antennae balls to the other ends of the wire.

Make eyes by pressing the small white balls onto the head, adding the yellow balls on top, and finally press the black balls on for pupils.

Indigo planting in Bengal dated back to 1777. Louis Bonard was the first Indigo Planter in India. With the expansion of British power, the indigo planting became more and more commercially profitable because of large demand of blue dye in the europe. The indigo planters left no stone unturned in making profits. The mercilessly pursued farmers to grow indigo instead of food crop. They provided loans called dadon at very high interest rate. Once farmer took such a loan he remained indebted forever and passed it on to his successors. The price payed by the planters for this cash crop was rediculously low, just 2.5% of the market price. The farmers were forced to sell at this price lest the planters would destroy their mortgage property. Govt rules also favoured the planters

Palm-leaf manuscripts  are manuscripts made out of dried palm leaves. Palm leaves were used as writing materials in South Asia and in Southeast Asia dating back to the 5th century BC and possibly much earlier. They were used to record actual and mythical narratives. Initially knowledge was passed down orally, but after the invention of alphabets and their diffusion throughout South Asia, people eventually began to write it down in dried and smoke treated palm leaves of Palmyra palm or talipot palm.

"-sucking midge, an aphid-munching anole lizard, brain-eating coffin fly maggots—they all pitch in to help the cocoa tree survive. A secondary layer of text delves deeper into statements such as ""Cocoa flowers can’t bloom without cocoa leaves . . . and maggots,"" explaining the interdependence of the plants and animals in the tropical rain forests. Two wise-cracking bookworms appear on every page, adding humor and further commentary, making this book accessible to readers of different ages and reading levels.

Back matter includes information about cocoa farming and rain forest preservation, as well as an author’s note"
I have read this book in my school's library and it was lovely.................

FRIENDSHIP IS THE SAKE THAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO US. GOOD FRIENDS NEVER CAME EVERY TIME. SO, WE SHOULD KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF FRIENDSHIP.
Hi Om! There is a saying: Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. We study history to find out more about ourselves, to learn from mistakes, to recall different ways of approaching things. There are many reasons, but my favorite is to remember and compare how different lives become after a few years.

"The classification of the farming systems of developing regions has been based on the following criteria:

available natural resource base, including water, land, grazing areas and forest; climate, of which altitude is one important determinant; landscape, including slope; farm size, tenure and organization; and


dominant pattern of farm activities and household livelihoods, including field crops, livestock, trees, aquaculture, hunting and gathering, processing and off-farm activities; and taking into account the main technologies used, which determine the intensity of production and integration of crops, livestock and other activities."

"whispered, 'that trees pray?'""

Grandad is the boy's best friend. Being with him always makes the world seem right. And how vast that world is. A world of tall trees that reach for the clouds and sun and moon and stars—and what else is reaching for heaven but a prayer?

Each time that he and Grandad walk in the woods, the boy listens for the prayers of the earth. And while he isn't always sure he hears them, Grandad's words inspire him to keep listening."
farming is fortunate
Our environment is a system of interaction between the natural system and the social system for meeting. Our human needs and wants are dependent on the biophysical environment, which is governed by a set of sovereign immutable laws. This will enable us to make a rational and appropriate use of environmental resources for suitable development

"are known as taxa (singular: taxon).
Modern biological classification has its root in the work of Carolus Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the Darwinian principle of common descent. With the introduction of the cladistic method in the early 20th century, formalized by Willi Hennig in the mid-20th century, phylogenetic taxonomy in which organisms are grouped purely on inferred evolutionary relatedness (based either on classical evidence of morphology, chemistry, physiology, ecology or molecular evidence or both) has become common in biology.[1] Molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue doing so. Biological classification belongs to the science of biological systematics."
Photosynthesis - The cycle of plants and how they make energy! The sun(light energy), water, minerals and carbon dioxide are all absorbed by the plant. The plant then uses them to make glucose/sugar, which is the energy/food for the plant. Oxygen is also produced by the plant in this cycle, which is then let off into the air! Have you noticed how clean and pure the air feels when there are plants around? They are filling the air with oxygen!
very much agree
Hi Nitesh! Do you know, many artists have dedicated songs to Mandela. One of the most popular was from The Special AKA who recorded the song "Free Nelson Mandela" in 1983, which Elvis Costello also recorded and had a hit with.

nicenicenicenicenice
Samarth da means
"Every living thing needs energy in order to live. Everytime animals do something (run, jump) they use energy to do so.
Animals get energy from the food they eat, and all living things get energy from food. Plants use sunlight, water and nutrients to get energy (in a process called photosynthesis). Energy is necessary for living beings to grow.
A food chain shows how each living thing gets food, and how nutrients and energy are passed from creature to creature. Food chains begin with plant-life, and end with animal-life. Some animals eat plants, some animals eat other animals."

"In A Great Aridness, William deBuys paints a compelling picture of what the Southwest might look like when the heat turns up and the water runs out. This semi-arid land, vulnerable to water shortages, rising temperatures, wildfires, and a host of other environmental challenges, is poised to bear the heaviest consequences of global environmental change in the United States. Examining interrelated factors such as vanishing wildlife, forest die backs, and the over-allocation of the already stressed Colorado River--upon which nearly 30 million people depend--the author narrates the landscape's history--and future. He tells the inspiring stories of the climatologists and others who are helping untangle the complex, interlocking causes and effects of global warming. And while the fate of this region may seem at first blush to be of merely local interest, what happens in the Southwest, deBuys suggests, will provide a glimpse of what other mid-latitude arid lands worldwide--the Mediterranean Basin, southern Africa, and the Middle East--will experience in the coming years. 

Written with an elegance that recalls the prose of John McPhee and Wallace Stegner, A Great Aridness offers an unflinching look at the dramatic effects of climate change occurring right now in our own backyard."

"But when the principal tries to tell the students that Mrs. Starch has been called away on a ""family emergency,"" Nick and Marta just don't buy it. No, they figure the class delinquent, Smoke, has something to do with her disappearance.

And he does! But not in the way they think. There's a lot more going on in Black Vine Swamp than any one player in this twisted tale can see. And Nick and Marta will have to reckon with an eccentric eco-avenger, a stuffed rat named Chelsea, a wannabe Texas oilman, a singing substitute teacher, and a ticked-off Florida panther before they really begin to see the big picture.

That's life in the swamp, kids"
its a far difference between these two

Hi Lismaria!! I agree with you, that India is the second-most populated country in this world. But, do you know, which is the most populated country in the world?
"There were three types of Himalayas 
1.Himadri
2.Himachal
3.Shiwaliks"
In Northern Indian Plains there were great population of people live.

their fiery Hollywood ending only serves to make the story that much more dramatic. But fossil evidence demonstrates that dinosaurs survived several mass extinctions, and were seemingly unaffected by catastrophes that decimated most other life on Earth. What could explain their uncanny ability to endure through the ages? Biologist and earth scientist Peter Ward now accounts for the remarkable indestructibility of dinosaurs by connecting their unusual respiration system with their ability to adapt to Earth's changing environment--a system that was ultimately bequeathed to their descendants, birds. By tracing the evolutionary path back through time and carefully connecting the dots from birds to dinosaurs, Ward describes the unique form of breathing shared by these two distant relatives and demonstrates how this simple but remarkable characteristic provides the elusive explanation to a question that has thus far stumped scientists. Nothing short of revolutionary in its bold presentation of an astonishing theory, "Out of Thin Air" is a story of science at the edge of discovery. Ward is an outstanding guide to the process of scientific detection. Audacious and innovative in his thinking, meticulous and thoroughly detailed in his research, only a scientist of his caliber is capable of telling this surprising story

"Promised Land where water falls from the sky and green stuff grows all around. We were about to begin the adventure of realigning our lives with our food chain. 

""Naturally, our first stop was to buy junk food and fossil fuel. . . .""

Hang on for the ride: With characteristic poetry and pluck, Barbara Kingsolver and her family sweep readers along on their journey away from the industrial-food pipeline to a rural life in which they vow to buy only food raised in their own neighborhood, grow it themselves, or learn to live without it. Their good-humored search yields surprising discoveries about turkey sex life and overly zealous zucchini plants, en route to a food culture that's better for the neighborhood and also better on the table. Part memoir, part journalistic investigation, Animal, Vegetable, Miracle makes a passionate case for putting the kitchen back at the center of family life and diversified farms at the center of the American diet.

""This is the story of a year in which we made every attempt to feed ourselves animals and vegetables whose provenance we really knew . . . and of how our family was changed by our first year of deliberately eating food produced from the same place where we worked, went to school, loved our neighbors, drank the water, and breathed the air."

About 16% of global final energy consumption presently comes from renewable resources, with 10%[4] of all energy from traditional biomass, mainly used for heating, and 3.4% from hydroelectricity. New renewables (small hydro, modern biomass, wind, solar, geothermal, and biofuels) account for another 3% and are growing rapidly.[5] At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond.[6] Wind power, for example, is growing at the rate of 30% annually, with a worldwide installed capacity of 282,482 megawatts (MW)
Whether you've never done any drawing before or have just bought a new type of pencil or pen, a great way to find out what each pencil can do is simply mark-making. Scribbling, doodling, call it what you will mark-making with the intent of exploring your new medium - without the pressure of creating a drawing - is a great way to gain confidence and get to know your materials.

"In day the air above land heats up quickly than air over water. The warm air over the land expands and rises and as cooler air is heavier it rushes to take place with this procedure wind is created. While in night its total different than day because in night air over land gets cooler quickly than air on over water.

The atmospheric winds that circles the earth are also created in same way because land near the Earth’s equator heats up more than the land near South and North Poles"

one more thing “Curiosity is a willing, a proud, and eager confession of ignorance.
Wind energy connectors work within majestic wind turbines, which tower over the ground at a height of 300 feet or more. Their height helps them capture faster, less turbulent wind, and their form is basic and efficient, as seen below. The blades, which change their angle depending on the wind’s direction, catch the great and invisible force, while the nacelle transfers the power through a gearbox to a generator, which leads into the grid network. The turbine can be finely adjusted for optimum performance, using techniques like pitch control and yawing to coordinate the mechanism with the wind’s mood swings.

An ecosystem is a complete community of living organisms and the nonliving materials of their surroundings. Thus, its components include plants, animals, and microorganisms; soil, rocks, and minerals; as well as surrounding water sources and the local atmosphere. The size of ecosystems varies tremendously. An ecosystem could be an entire rain forest, covering a geographical area larger than many nations, or it could be a puddle or a backyard garden. Even the body of an animal could be considered an ecosystem, since it is home to numerous microorganisms. On a much larger scale, the history of various human societies provides an instructive illustration as to the ways that ecosystems have influenced civilizations
"Renewable energy is clean, affordable, domestic, and effectively infinite. It produces no emissions and results in cleaner air and water for all. Renewable power creates jobs and generates revenue for local communities. Revenue from solar and wind farms helps stimulate local economies that need new roads, schools, libraries, and hospitals.

The United States has some of the best wind resources in the world, with enough potential energy to produce nearly 10 times the country's existing power needs. Wind energy is now one of the most cost-effective sources of new generation, competing with new installations of coal, gas and nuclear power. Its cost has dropped steadily over the past few years, as wind turbine technology has improved. Currently, over 400 American manufacturing plants build wind components, towers and blades."

Drawing is a form of visual art that makes use of any number of drawing instruments to mark a two-dimensional medium. Instruments used include graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, various kinds of erasers, markers, styluses, and various metals
Have you ever been told that you're holding your pencil the wrong way? Or that there is only one right way to hold a pencil for drawing? Chances are that this well-intentioned advice wasn't quite right. There is no single right way, and whatever 'works' for you is probably the best choice. This short article demonstrates the most popular ways to hold a pencil for various drawing effects. Try experimenting with various pencil grips, as different methods will suit you for various effects, and you may find some more comfortable than others.

As you have learned about the biosphere, biomes, and specific ecosystems, we have been mentioning the cycles all around you. Whether you look at the food chain or the growth and reduction of populations, ecosystems are always shifting and changing. Forests have spring when plants bloom, autumn when they lose leaves, and winters in the snow. The cycle begins again the next spring.
Biomes, tropical rainforests, coniferous woodland, deciduous woodlands, savannah grassland, desert, tundra, human uses of rainforests, human uses of the savannah, human uses of the desert, human uses of temperate deciduous woodlands

Drawing a great portrait or tackling a figure drawing is something we all want to do. What can be more expressive than the human figure and face? Whether it's a portrait of a wise old man or a drawing of a broken angel, the innocent joy in a child's eyes or the black tears of gothic pain, we love the most challenging subjects. But for the developing artist, it's a bit like a musician trying to only play a great concerto and skipping the scales. I know you don't want to believe me, but going straight for the masterpiece really isn't a good idea.

When you are teaching yourself to draw using books and the internet, it can be difficult to know how to improve. Without a teacher to help, we tend to keep making the same mistakes for longer than a student in a classroom. The key to overcoming this obstacle is to learn to look at your work with a fresh, critical eye. We should feel rightly proud of the progress we make each time we create a new drawing - don't let small flaws spoil your enjoyment! We need mistakes because they help us to learn. Here is a list of the most common mistakes that beginners make

Wary of inhibiting their creativity, we tend to avoid teaching drawing to children. But they are receiving input from all around them, and want to learn to draw. Why let them flounder when we can provide positive models? So how do we approach teaching of drawing to children? It depends on what stage of development they are at, and of course, every child is different.

The biosphere is all about life. Physical geographers use the term biosphere to describe our living world. All of the microbes, plants, and animals can be found somewhere in the biosphere. The biosphere extends to the upper areas of the atmosphere where birds and insects can be found. It also reaches to dark caves deep in the ground or to the bottom of the ocean at hydrothermal vents. The biosphere extends to any place that life of any kind might exist

"This book has terrific illustrations and a simple text that discusses the formation and features of rocks. With a nice Rocks Chart in the back, students can see how to classify rocks by kind, color, what it feels like, and its uses. Offered in a Spanish edition as well.Grades K-2.

Curriculum Connection: Science Standard 3.1: Earth’s materials can be compared and classified based on their properties. Before reading the rock book to students, I would begin by modeling some essential questions I would like students to be able to answer during our study, such as ""How do rocks form and what types are there? How are rocks used? and Who studies rocks and why?"" An empty gathering grid would be ready to go on the computer and projected on the screen in front of us. As we read the information, we can record together, typing the source and the page numbers as we go. If students have access to science kits, there should be some rocks to sort, and students could work in teams to fill in a chart like this of their own. To check understanding, students can bring a rock in and place it on a display table, underneath the appropriate section labeled igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. (There should be additional rocks available for those that do not bring one in, so they can also demonstrate their knowledge.)It would be fun to let students save their milk cartons, fill with sand, and a ½ glue/ ½ water mixture and let dry several days to make a sandstone brick!

The difference doesn't show up clearly in the scan, but you can see that the side shading has a grainier, softer look and covers a large area quickly (a chisel-point pencil will also give this effect).
become more satisfied with your results, and feel that you're drawing well, it is easy to keep working in the same reliable way

"Human Environmental Interactions can be defined as interactions between the human social system and (the “rest” of) the ecosystem.
Human social systems and ecosystems are complex adaptive systems (Marten, 2001). Complex because ecosystems and human social systems have many parts and many connections between these parts. Adaptive because they have feedback structures that promote survival in a constantly changing environment."

What’s the real difference between drawing and sketching? To answer to this conundrum, let’s first establish that sketching is a form of drawing, and drawing is the method we produce marks in a sketch. Drawing can simply be defined as making marks on a surface. The two descriptions are often used interchangeably. It’s really no surprise that there is some confusion
Water is everywhere on Earth. About seventy percent of the surface of the Earth is covered by water. If you were an alien visiting the planet, you would see a giant blue sphere from space (especially on the Pacific Ocean side). Not only is water everywhere, but all life depends on water. The tiniest bacteria and the largest dinosaurs have all needed water. The hydrosphere is the world of water that surrounds all of us

All living things need energy to live, and energy comes from food. But, have you ever seen plants munching on pizza or eating a bowl of cereal? Nope. Plants get their energy in a different way. They use photosynthesis. Here’s how it works:
Some plants are carnivores, gaining nutrients by eating various small insects and spiders. A well known example of a carnivorous plant is the Venus Flytrap.

I wanna read this book

Cute book about an old shoe maker/repairman. Mim and I liked Shoo Shoo...and it was a nice, neat happy little book....and it had shoes in it! ;)
"garden in Amritsar, Punjab to protest against the arrest of two leaders despite a curfew which had been recently declared.[1] On the orders of Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer, the army fired on the crowd for ten minutes, directing their bullets largely towards the few open gates through which people were trying to run out. The figures released by the British government were 370 dead and 1200 wounded. Other sources place the number dead at well over 1000. This ""brutality stunned the entire nation"",[2] resulting in a ""wrenching loss of faith"" of the general public in the intentions of Britain.[3] The ineffective inquiry and the initial accolades for Dyer by the House of Lords fuelled widespread anger, leading to the Non-cooperation Movement of 1920–22.[4]

On Sunday, 13 April 1919, Dyer was convinced of a major insurrection and he banned all meetings, however this notice was not widely disseminated. That was the day of Baisakhi, the main Sikh festival, and many villagers had gathered in the Bagh. On hearing that a meeting had assembled at Jallianwala Bagh, Dyer went with fifty Gurkha riflemen to a raised bank and ordered them to shoot at the crowd. Dyer continued the firing for about ten minutes, until the ammunition supply was almost exhausted; Dyer stated that 1,650 rounds had been fired, a number which seems to have been derived by counting empty cartridge cases picked up by the troops.[5] Official British Indian sources gave a figure of 379 identified dead,[5] with approximately 1,100 wounded. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500, with approximately 1,000 dead.[6]

Dyer was initially lauded by conservative forces in the empire, but in July 1920 he was censured and forced to retire by the House of Commons.[7] He became a celebrated hero in Britain among most of the people connected to the British Raj,[8] for example, the House of Lords,[9] but unpopular in the House of Commons, that voted against Dyer twice.[10] The massacre caused a re-evaluation of the army's role, in which the new policy became ""minimum force"", and the army was retrained and developed suitable tactics for crowd control.[11] Some historians consider the episode as a decisive step towards the end of British rule in India,[12] although others believe that greater self-government was inevitable as a result of India's involvement in World War"
But it hasn’t all been an easy ride. For example, one of my best friends is my ex-husband. It took years of work to move through heart-ache, anger, grief, and resentment in order to find the strong friendship we have now. To create a true friendship takes a lot of effort and dedication.

If you're not a microbe and you're not an animal, chances are you are a plant. There are loads of species of plants on Earth. Just as there is a system of classification for animals, there is also a system of classification for plants. Because plants adapt so well to any climate, scientists need a way to organize the hundreds of thousands of species.

"Short Speech on Unity and Diversity in India (455 Words)

by Puja Mondal India

 
Here is your speech on Unity and Diversity in India !

India is a vast peninsula with a total land area of about 33 million Sq. Kms, and population exceeding 100 crores. Its length from North to South is about 3.200 Kilometers and breadth from East to West is nearly 3,000 Kilometers. Because of its area and population India is generally referred to as a sub-continent."
So, cute
it keep us fit and healthy.....
Some people don't like to do hard work so they steal and some people make it their passion so they steal it can be both yes or no but we cannot come on final decision

To not have a child is very difficult for people as having something to love, protect and spoil is a very beautiful sensation. The old couple had their dog whom they loved, protected and spoiled. No wonder, losing such an object or person or animal is a great loss to anybody including the couple. So, I agree.
The son of Motilal Nehru, a prominent lawyer and nationalist statesman, Nehru was a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge and the Inner Temple, where he trained to be a barrister. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Allahabad High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. A committed nationalist since his teenage years, Nehru became a rising figure in Indian politics during the upheavals of the 1910s. He became the prominent leader of the left-wing factions of the Indian National Congress during the 1920s, and eventually of the entire Congress, with the tacit approval of his mentor, Gandhi. As Congress President in 1929, Nehru called for complete independence from the British Raj and instigated the Congress's decisive shift towards the left.

This discovery was significant and opened the way for a age of global imperialism and for the Portuguese to establish a long-lasting colonial empire in Asia. The route meant that the Portuguese would not need to cross the highly disputed Mediterranean nor the dangerous Arabian Peninsula, and that the whole voyage would be made by sea. The sum of the outward and return voyages made this expedition the longest ocean voyage in World history made until then, far superior in distance to a full voyage around the World by the Equator

The Plantae Kingdom is made up of all the plants that you see each day. Most plants are multi-cellular, meaning that they consist of many cells. Different types of plants include trees, grass, flowers, and some types of algae.
Eating good foods is especially important for kids because they are still growing. Kids' bodies need nutrition to grow strong healthy bones and muscles. If you don't get all the vitamins and minerals you need while you are growing, you won't grow as tall and as strong as you could be.
feel elements such as embedded foil yarn, and more, proves to kids that, in a world where fitting in is the norm, being different is what makes us special.

It is the land of many languages it is only in India people professes all the major religions of the world. In short, India is “the epitome of the world”. The vast population is composed of people having diverse creeds, customs and colours. Some of the important forms of diversity in India are discussed below"
Plants are very useful to us and we get most of our food from plants. Everybody needs food to stay alive. Food is one of our basic needs. It gives us energy to work. Most of our food comes from plants. Plants give us many things.
OMGGGGGGG!!!!!!!
Food gives energy and is essential for the growth. Different kinds of food comes from different sources. The main source of food are plants and animals.
so sad........
NO. WE CAN ALSO HAS MANY TYPES OF FRIENDS BUT ONLY WITH GOOD HABITS.

Pashmina refers to a type of fine cashmere wool and the textiles made from it and were first woven in India.[1][2] The name comes from Pashmineh (پشمینه), Persian for "made from "Pashm" (meaning "wool" in Persian).[2] The wool comes from changthangi or Pashmina goat, (first time discovery by Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani in Ladakh) which is a special breed of goat indigenous to high altitudes of the Himalayas in India, Nepal and Pakistan. Pashmina shawls are hand spun, woven and embroidered in Nepal and Kashmir, and made from fine cashmere fibre

He claimed descent from the Berber tribe known as the Lawata.[4] As a young man he would have studied at a Sunni Maliki madh'hab, (Islamic jurisprudence school), the dominant form of education in North Africa at that time.[5] In June 1325, at the age of twenty-one, Ibn Battuta set off from his hometown on a hajj, or pilgrimage, to Mecca, a journey that would take sixteen months. He would not see Morocco again for twenty-four years.

The region was a prominent spice exporter from 3000 BCE to 3rd century. The Chera Dynasty was the first powerful kingdom based in Kerala, though it frequently struggled against attacks from the neighbouring Cholas and Pandyas. During the Chera period, Kerala remained an international spice trading center. Later, in the 15th century, the lucrative spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and eventually paved the way for the European colonisation of the whole of India. After independence, Travancore and Cochin joined the Republic of India and Travancore-Cochin was given the status of a state. Later, the state was formed in 1956 by merging the Malabar district, Travancore-Cochin (excluding four southern taluks), and the taluk of Kasargod, South Kanara.
The epic is composed of a very large body of versions, each with many variants, and is reputed by some to be the longest in the world.[12] Although there is no one definitive text, the Chinese compilation so far of just its Tibetan versions has filled some 120 volumes, more than one million verses,[13] divided into 29 "chapters".[14] Western calculations speak of more than 50 different books edited so far in China, India and Tibet
When you think of plants, you probably think of flowers, vegetables and trees. But there are many other kinds of plants too. How about mosses and lichens or algae that grows in the water? Ferns have been around for millions of years. Mushrooms, on the other hand, are not plants, but a fungus.

We're going to look at plant structure in this section. The plants we discuss will be vascular plants that have systems of tubes (xylem and phloem) for the transport of nutrients and water. Remember that there is a wide variety of plants on Earth and even a whole group that doesn't have vascular systems. Mosses and liverworts may still have photosynthesis, but they do not have that 'classic' plant structure. Then you will find species such as cacti that don't have leaves. They conduct photosynthesis in their stems. Anyway, just remember that there are many other possibilities in the plant kingdom.
Learn about trees, flowers, seeds, fruit and all kinds of interesting plant topics. As well as activities for children, there are also lesson plans and worksheets for teachers, ideas for parents and a whole host of free teaching resources for anyone interested in learning about plants or other science subjects online.

Fun book that made me laugh. It is about a little girl who was baking bread with her mom and little brother. The two siblings kept fighting so the mother told the little girl to go ask around at the neighbors and find a three-handed rolling pin. The girl went from house to house. Each family was from a different culture. They each were baking and let the girl try their bread. All day she got to visit with friends and neighbors. Eventually she realizes her mom had tricked her, there is no such thing as a three-handed rolling pin. The mother simples wanted the brother and sister to stop fighting. The girls was happy she was able to visit so many people. In the back of the book was all the recipes of the breads shown in the book. This book involved pictures that signified cultures from all over the world. Great way to show different traditions for different people

"Book: I am Different! Can You Find Me? by Manjula Padmanabhan with copyright date of 2011 by The Global Fund for Children. Recommended for ages 5-8. Presents diverse languages from many cultures.

Reflection: Text to World. This multicultural picture book is a great introduction to languages around the world. I connect to this book after traveling around the world and having students from all over the world. This book would be great to introduce a new student from a new place to the rest of the classroom! It includes the phrase can you find me in many diverse languages such as Filipino, Spanish, English, Chinese, Navajo, and many more.

Bloom's Taxonomy Questions.
1. Can you ist each different country and one word you learned from that country?
2. How can you show how you would use the new language to greet a new student in his/ her language?
3. Diagram using a word web the countries and languages you read about.
4. Can you model how to use American Sign Language to say, ""Can you Find Me?""
5. Explain why you think only 2,000 people speak Hawaiian?
6. Can you compare and contrast the different languages and tell why some are easier or you then others?"

"A Pirali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[9] At age sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha (""Sun Lion""), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[6][10] He graduated to his first short stories and dramas—and the aegis of his birth name—by 1877. As a humanist, universalist internationalist, and strident nationalist he denounced the Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy endures also in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University.[11][12][13][14][15]

Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's Jana Gana Mana and Bangladesh's Amar Shonar Bangla. The original song of Sri Lanka’s National Anthem was also written and tuned by Tagore."
In the first half of the 1st millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism; later still, in the ninth century, Kashmir Shaivism arose.[1] In 1349, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the Salatin-i-Kashmir or Swati dynasty.[2] For the next five centuries, Muslim monarchs ruled Kashmir, including the Mughals, who ruled from 1526 until 1751, and the Afghan Durrani Empire, which ruled from 1747 until 1820.[2] That year, the Sikhs, under Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir.[2] In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage) of the British Crown, lasted until 1947, when the former princely state became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: India, Pakistan, and the People's Republic of China

All Children Have Different Eyes is a beautifully illustrated story empowering children who have visual impairment to take on the social challenges of daily life, such as how to deal with bullies, explain their condition confidently, enter play groups, and handle mistakes responsibly. Activities in the back of the book help parents and teachers reinforce these skills every day. It's not only for the visually impaired child, though. All readers learn that visual impairment is not so scary or strange. Through this awareness, children are able to become better friends and playmates with kids like Tommy and Wendy, our stars.
So  cute

This manga is so cool and I thought I was going to throw it when I finished it, I just couldn't accept that it was finished. I wanted more one shots! I didn't really like Mayu Sakai's Peter Pan Syndrome but Magic Shoe Shop is so cool. I really liked their wishes especially the part of the brother-sister thing, I was like "aaaawww". And I felt a little sorry where the guy who kidnapped a little girl(which later on we discover that little girl's real identity)was shot, I mean c'mon he just wanted freedom. He didn't have a choice, he didn't deserve an end like that, okay you can put him behind the bars but don't kill him, he's so handsome to die! HAHAHAHA! Okay, sorry for getting carried away. Another thing that I liked about this manga is Sakai-san's talent in creating her characters, she drew them in a cool way. I admire he

"[5]

Historically, the region included the Baltistan (Baltiyul) valleys, the northern Indus Valley, the remote Zangskar, Lahaul and Spiti to the south, Aksai Chin and Ngari, including the Rudok region and Guge, in the east, and the Nubra valleys to the north.

Contemporary Ladakh borders Tibet to the east, the Lahaul and Spiti to the south, the Vale of Kashmir, Jammu and Baltiyul regions to the west, and the trans–Kunlun territory of Xinjiang to the far north. Ladakh is renowned for its remote mountain beauty and culture.

In the past Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade routes,[6] but since the Chinese authorities closed the borders with Tibet and Central Asia in the 1960s, international trade has dwindled except for tourism. Since 1974, the Government of India has successfully encouraged tourism in Ladakh. Since Ladakh is a part of strategically important Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian military maintains a strong presence in the region.

The largest town in Ladakh is Leh. Almost half of Ladakhis are Tibetan Buddhists and the rest are mostly Shia Muslims.[7] Leh is followed by Kargil as the largest town in Ladakh.[8] Some Ladakhi activists have in recent times called for Ladakh to be constituted as a union territory because of perceived unfair treatment by Kashmir and Ladakh's cultural differences with predominantly Muslim Kashmir.[9][10]

In 1991, a Peace Pagoda was erected in the region by Nipponzan Myohoji."

"instrumental in bringing the Peters Equal Area Map to North America. He has been leading the discussion of what maps mean and the power of maps in framing human activities.

In How Maps Change Things Kaiser takes a passionate view of how maps illustrate and influence the significant paths humans pursue. Rather than looking for definitive answers, Kaiser focuses on asking thought-provoking questions. ""What does our world, through the view of maps, really look like and what does the perspective (or frame of reference or bias) of the viewer mean to the map and its view? Are all maps simply propaganda for the hidden agenda of the map-maker? What is the world we get and what is the world we want ... and who cares and why?"" Kaiser has stimulated an impressive and important conversation."

I teach Photosynthesis to my 4th graders and compare it to making sugar cookies. I tell them that they need certain ingredients to make cookies and you need certain ingredients to make Photosynthesis happen. We list the "ingredients" and then I compare the sun (light) for Photo to the heat of the oven (since you need light for Photosynthesis to get going and you need the oven for the cookies to bake.

My children were supposed to be in bed, but they saw me reading Shoemaker Martin by Bernadette Watts and begged for one more story. Strictly speaking, this isn’t a Christmas story, but this tale of a man seeking Christ captures the spirit of the season. This book is based on a short story by Leo Tolstoy called “Where Love is, God is". Martin the cobbler reads the Bible each night and wonders how he would receive a visit from Jesus. He is woken from his sleep that night by a voice saying, “Martin, be sure you watch the street tomorrow, for I shall come.” The next day Martin is ready. He receives many visitors and is filled with joy!

nice  synopsis
A magnet in its simplest form, is a material that generates a magnetic field. The magnetic field is produced from the magnets’ goal to find the easiest (shortest) route from the North Pole to the South Pole, and vise versa. The magnetic field of a magnet can not be seen but is the reason for the ‘pulling force’ to other magnets and ferrous materials. A larger magnet will inevitably have a larger magnetic field and will attract objects from further way. There are many different types of magnets but Alnico is the preferred choice in schools for easy handling and much less risk than Neodymium, which is much more powerful.

A balanced diet is important because your body’s organs and tissues need proper nutrition to work effectively. Without good nutrition, your body is more prone to disease, infection, fatigue, and poor performance. Children with a poor diet run the risk of growth and developmental problems. Bad eating habits can continue for the rest of their lives.

animals are sensitive, atleast humans can express their sadness with a speech but they can not express it through speech. they have to keep that burden in their minds. they're sensitive nut show themselves strong. they're intelligent not mean like human being are to harm environment.

how important is quality to you? It’s very important to me. Unfortunately, a lot of the time it’s also very expensive. But not all of the time. It depends on what you buy. I can buy very good quality clothes very cheaply. They are often the same quality as brand names. It’s also easy to buy good quality food. I go to vegetable and fish markets to get good quality and cheap food. It’s much better than the stuff in supermarkets. It can also be cheaper. I’d love a good quality car, but this is where my budget runs out. It’s still possible to buy a top-of-the-range Japanese car which is the same quality as a much more expensive German one. I do spend a little extra to buy a top quality computer – an Apple
I know this story.............
it important as it blocks the clouds carrying water forcing it to pour.and also it is a source of a no.of rivers

"A number of distinct names, sometimes local, exist for stepwells. In Hindi-speaking regions, they include names based on baudi (including bawdi, bawri, baoli, bavadi, bavdi). In Gujarati and Marwari language, they are usually called vav or vaav.

All forms of the stepwell are examples of the many types of storage and irrigation tanks that were developed in India, mainly to cope with seasonal fluctuations in water availability. A basic difference between stepwells on the one hand, and tanks and wells on the other, was to make it easier for people to reach the ground water, and to maintain and manage the well."

in 1648. Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to the older Salimgarh Fort, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546. The imperial apartments consist of a row of pavilions, connected by a water channel known as the Stream of Paradise (Nahr-i-Behisht). The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity under Shah Jahan. Although the palace was planned according to Islamic prototypes, each pavilion contains architectural elements typical of Mughal buildings, reflecting a fusion of Timurid, Persian and Hindu traditions. The Red Fort’s innovative architectural style, including its garden design, influenced later buildings and gardens in Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Kashmir, Braj, Rohilkhand and elsewhere.[1] With the Salimgarh Fort, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.[1][3]

But for farm entrepreneurs, the opportunities for a farm family business have never been greater. The aging farm population is creating cavernous niches begging to be filled by creative visionaries who will go in dynamic new directions. As the industrial agriculture complex crumbles and our culture clambers for clean food, the countryside beckons anew with profitable farming opportunities.While this book can be helpful to all farmers, it targets the wannabes, the folks who actually entertain notions of living, loving and learning on a piece of land. Anyone willing to dance with such a dream should be able to assess its assets and liabilities; its fantasies and realities. "Is it really possible for me?" is the burning question this book addresses
IT WAS TO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
Disagree, because there is very few water on our earth and we have to add more and more water so that people can live happily.
Of course they are, if animals are not there we will not get milk and other things which we get from animals.

Yes, it is right.
Reading history probably could not be more interesting. An intriguing narration of the 1957 Sepoy Mutiny. Documenting the events in the way a modern journalist reports about war or a terror strike, William Dalrymple has narrated the events and the circumstances leading to the mutiny, the mutiny itself, the causes of its failure and the aftermath, even assuming its effect in the shaping of India.
I  KNOW IT VERY WELL.

"There is no direct link between the availability of natural resources and the level of economic development. There are many countries which are rich in natural resources but still they are underdeveloped.

In fact, for the economic development of a country, optimum exploitation of natural resources is more important than their availability. Nevertheless, importance of natural resources cannot be undermined. Natural resources of a country influence not only economic growth but also its economic structure."
I have read this book so many times.

oriented questions aspiring writers might ask: Short humor -- what is it and who cares? Why write for magazines? Does a first book author need an agent? What do you mean by "indirection" in a story? In addition, he includes ten of his funniest and most treasured stories -- including "The Big Trip", "The Night the Bear Ate Goombaw", and "Muldoon in Love" -- and provides commentary on the tales. Open and candid, he shares where the ideas for the stories originated, the various techniques he employed, and helpful hints and common pitfalls. Writers of all ages (not to mention fans of McManus) will enjoy this funny, revealing book

"beloved as a bicycle odyssey, a literary masterpiece that describes in painstaking detail one 150-kilometer race in a mere 150 pages. We are, every inch of the way, inside amateur biker Tim Krabbé's head as his mind churns at top speed along with his furious peddling. Privy to his every thought-on the glory and vagaries of the sport itself, the weather, the characters and lineage of his rival cyclists, almost hallucinogenic anecdotes about great riders of the past-the book progresses kilometer by kilometer, thought by thought, and the reader is left breathless and exhilarated. 
A thrillingly realistic look at what it is like to compete in a road race, The Rider is the ultimate book for bike lovers as well as the arm-chair sports enthusiast.
Author Biography: Tim Krabbé is one of Holland's leading writers, and his novels are published all over the world. His many books include The Vanishing, which was made into a successful film, and The Cave. He lives in Amsterdam."

Too much sun & moisture can have a negative effect on the plant though so be careful when giving it nutrients. Keep the amounts in balance and see how long you can keep the plant growing healthily. Experiment with different conditions, what does closing the blinds and removing the sunlight do? What happens if you forget to water the plant or add too much water? How about if the conditions become too hot or too cold? Can you take care of the plant for 4 weeks? Take up the challenge and give it a try. This fun, educational game is perfect for kids.

story
"complex, and insidious forms, as parents and educators know all too well.
 
No writer is better poised to explore this territory than Emily Bazelon, who has established herself as a leading voice on the social and legal aspects of teenage drama. In Sticks and Stones, she brings readers on a deeply researched, clear-eyed journey into the ever-shifting landscape of teenage meanness and its sometimes devastating consequences. The result is an indispensable book that takes us from school cafeterias to courtrooms to the offices of Facebook, the website where so much teenage life, good and bad, now unfolds.
 
Along the way, Bazelon defines what bullying is and, just as important, what it is not. She explores when intervention is essential and when kids should be given the freedom to fend for themselves. She also dispels persistent myths: that girls bully more than boys, that online and in-person bullying are entirely distinct, that bullying is a common cause of suicide, and that harsh criminal penalties are an effective deterrent. Above all, she believes that to deal with the problem, we must first understand it.
 
Blending keen journalistic and narrative skills, Bazelon explores different facets of bullying through the stories of three young people who found themselves caught in the thick of it. Thirteen-year-old Monique endured months of harassment and exclusion before her mother finally pulled her out of school. Jacob was threatened and physically attacked over his sexuality in eighth grade—and then sued to protect himself and change the culture of his school. Flannery was one of six teens who faced criminal charges after a fellow student’s suicide was blamed on bullying and made international headlines. With grace and authority, Bazelon chronicles how these kids’ predicaments escalated, to no one’s benefit, into community-wide wars. Cutting through the noise, misinformation, and sensationalism, she takes us into schools that have succeeded in reducing bullying and examines their successful strategies. The result is a groundbreaking book that will help parents, educators, and teens themselves better understand what kids are going through today and what can be done to help them through it.

Praise for Sticks and Stones
 
“Intelligent, rigorous . . . [Emily Bazelon] is a compassionate champion for justice in the domain of childhood’s essential unfairness"
wow! it 's amazing

"friends. Second, he is beaten up by the town bully; the bullies at home always ignored him. Third, the richest man in town begins to plot Jack's imminent, and hopefully painful, demise. It's up to Jack to figure out why suddenly everyone cares so much about him. Back home he was practically, well, invisible.

The Mostly True Story of Jack is an eerie tale of magic, friendship, and sacrifice. It's about things broken and things put back together. Above all, it's about finding a place to belong"

i have read this story
"starting with her own mother. She came to realize that everyone is born with an open heart, but that we quickly learn to put conditions on our happiness—comparing ourselves to others, casting judgment, doubting ourselves, allowing fear or entitlement or self-righteousness to take hold—and slowly our hearts begin to close. We isolate ourselves, feeling alone, disconnected, and unheard; and in doing so we immobilize our spirit, stifle our authentic expression, and cut off our joy.

As she went on, Agapi, like so many of us, came under the soul-constricting influences of the larger world. In her struggle to find her place and her voice, trying to balance the acting career she dreamed of with the spiritual life she longed for, she discovered a path that was uniquely hers. Unbinding the Heart shows how she found her way home to herself.

In 32 personal, heartfelt stories full of insight and humor, Agapi takes us from her mother’s bountiful kitchen, where the seeds of fearless living were planted, to the London classical stage, to an epiphany on a New York City bus—and inspires readers with the confidence to let go of the beliefs that bind them and come to a deeper understanding of life and love"

I remember hearing an anecdote that i would like to share. Once Abraham Lincoln was sitting with his adviser discussing his plans so his adviser asked him that, "Sir, what to do about your enemies? They are going to harm you if we don't stop them." Lincoln replied," Don't you worry, I will end all my enemies by tomorrow." The next whole day went by and at night the adviser saw Lincoln having dinner and enjoying with his enemies. So he asked Lincoln," Sir, they are your enemies. You said you would kill them and yet here you are." Lincoln replied," My dear friend I did not say I will kill them I said I will end my enemies. And I did that by making them my friends, they are not my enemies anymore. It takes an effort to fight but it takes a lot more effort to forgive and be the bigger and wiser person.

Saturn is the second largest planet. Only Jupiter is larger. Saturn has seven thin, flat rings around it. A couple of planets have rings, but their rings are much fainter than those around Saturn. Saturn's diameter at its equator is 74,600 miles which is almost ten times that of Earth.

Four the planets in the Solar System have rings. They are the four giant gas planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Saturn, which has by far the largest ring system, was known to have rings for a long time. It was not until the 1970s that rings were discovered around the other gas planets. The rings around Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune are much smaller, darker, and fainter than the rings of Saturn. Rings around gas giants are thought to be transient over the the lifetime of the planetary system. That is, if we had lived at a very different time, perhaps we would not see big rings around Saturn, but another one of the gas giants.
It is very useful in our day to day life.....

"This is a great little book (probably aimed at middle-school kids, but great reading even for adults) telling a short version of the story of the Constitutional Convention. It is peppered with little tidbits about the delegates (like fishing habits or what they wrote home to their children) that give them personality and humanity. Told in simple and straightforward language, it also hits on all of the hot-button topics that would ultimately lead to four months of deliberation and debate: state rights, representation, slavery, how to choose a president, etc. I also gained a better sense of the important distinction between the terms ""national"" (a central government with power over the states) and ""federal"" (a government of an association of states that give up none of their individual rights). The original Constitution never used the word ""national"" because it was so offensive to many of the delegates. Our states therefore were joined into a federation, and not a nation, to create the United States of America. 

Overall, an enjoyable and educational read. The full text (and it's not very long) of the original Constitution is included at the end of the book. ""We the people"" never fails to inspire a little thrill of pride"

I got this book from a Scholastic book order. What a cute story! The story is written in rhyme and contains many plays-on-words. There is a mouse Capitol that was built to emulate the human U.S. Capitol. There's the Squeaker of the House and the Senate Mouse-jority Leader. A second grade class in Mousesourri proposes a bill to name a national cheese. The winner?American, of course! THis book was a hit with my second graders and provided some background knowledge about the process for making laws. I think intermediate students would enjoy it as they learn about the legislative branch in greater dep
Mrs. Bush talk about when you have dinner?" "What will you do after you are president? Will you write a book and make a lot of money like the other presidents?
"This is not a book explaining the provisions of the constitution, but the motives and the situations that the resulted in framing the constitution the way it was.
The debates on fundamental rights, federal vs unitary government, language and minority rights are an eye opener for all"
WHILE WE DO NOT WERE SYNTHETIC OR SILK CLOTHES BECAUSE THEY CAN CATCH FIRE VERY EASILY.

Simply put, it is the most enjoyable and groundbreaking way to read the governing document of the United States. Spirited and visually witty, it roves article by article, amendment by amendment, to get at the meaning, background, and enduring relevance of the law of the land

HE WAS NO MORE SELFISH AND JEALOUS.
HE WAS JEALOUS AND DIDN'T LET THE CHILDREN TO PLAY IN HIS GARDEN. SO, SPRING NEVER CAME INTO THE GIANT'S GARDEN.
THE REMARKS REMIND ME OF LORD JESUS CHRIST AS HE WAS ALSO GIVEN THE SAME PAIN.
THIS INDICATES THAT THE GIANT HAD BEEN BLESSED BY LORD CHRIST HIMSELF. HE WAS NEITHER CRUEL NOR SELFISH. SO CHRIST FORGAVE HIM AND TOOK HIM TO THE PARADISE.
THE GIANT WAS BLESSED BY LORD CHRIST.
THAT HOW THE CHILDREN NOTICED THE HOLE MADE IN THE GIANT'S WALL. THAT'S GREAT.

(11 November 1888 – 22 February 1958) was an Indian scholar and a senior political leader of the Indian independence movement. Following India's independence, he became the first Minister of Education in the Indian government. In 1992 he was posthumously awarded India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna.[1] There is also a theory which suggests that earlier when he was offered Bharat Ratna he promptly declined it saying that it should not be given to those who have been on the selection committee. Later he was awarded posthumously in 1992. He is commonly remembered as Maulana Azad; the word Maulana is an honorific meaning 'learned man', and he had adopted Azad (Free) as his pen name. His contribution to establishing the education foundation in India is recognised by celebrating his birthday as "National Education Day" across India.[2]

"Indian National Congress and one of the founding fathers of the Republic of India. He was a social leader who played a leading role in the country's struggle for independence and guided its integration into a united, independent nation. In India and elsewhere, he was often addressed as Sardar, which means Chief in Hindi, Urdu and Persian.

He was raised in the countryside of Gujarat.[1] Vallabhbhai Patel was employed in successful practice as a lawyer. Patel subsequently organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against oppressive policies imposed by the British Raj; in this role, he became one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He rose to the leadership of the Indian National Congress and was at the forefront of rebellions and political events, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937, and promoting the Quit India movement."

Glazing isn't the only way to create beautiful surfaces! Agateware pottery features swirling marbelized colors and was probably first developed to imitate the qualities of agate, a semiprecious stone with striated patterning. These swirling effects can be created by working with thin slabs of colored clay that has been layered to create patterns. This technique allows for both precise patterns and free, random effects.

A river is a natural watercourse, usually of fresh water, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea, or another river. Rivers form part of the hydrological cycle. This is a list of rivers in India. Rivers that flow into the sea are geographically, along the coast starting from the Bay of Bengal in the east, moving along the Indian coast southward to Kanyakumari, then northward along the Arabian Sea. Tributary rivers are listed hierarchically in upstream order: the lower in the list, the more upstream.

"with quotes from Dr. King...all powerfully brought to life by Collier's striking, glorious art. 

Rappaport's spare, gripping text and Collier's distinctive collage-and-watercolor illustrations depict King's life journey with reverence and dignity -- beginning with his childhood experience of seeing ""White Only"" signs throughout his hometown, presenting his efforts as a civil rights crusader, and ending abruptly with his assassination. The front cover of the book immediately conveys King's power and spiritual strength, consisting entirely of a lifelike portrait of him -- the title and the author's and illustrator's names are relegated to the back cover. As Collier says in his illustrator's note, he ""tried to push [the imagery] to an emotional level that allows the reader to bring his or her own experience to it, without actually losing the intensity or the intention of the story."" His technique is utterly effective. 


By using simple, direct language -- much of it King's -- the text offers young readers an accessible yet profound introduction to King's legacy. It explains that as a child, he listened to his minister father's ""big words"" and vowed to inspire others with such words when he grew up. The book's final sentence: ""His big words are alive for us today,"" testifies to King's success -- and to the timeless importance of this great leader's ideals. As further inspiration for interested readers, Martin's Big Words includes a list of significant dates as well as a bibliography of resources for them to explore. (Jamie Levine)"
"Great book, easy words for children learning to read. Like the fact that while it uses phonics there are also ""patterns"" for the words eg Goose and Loose so is suited to pattern recognition methods of learning to read as well.

Have bought the whole series as daughter loves these. While the words are simple there's still enough of a story/action to keep her interested (just) while too many early reading books are three word sentences, one sentence per page and only a few pages per book. 

This set of books is top of the learn to read books we've come across so far"

Although this is a collection of poems and short stories, I have included it in my "poetry" selections. I loved listening to record and casette tape recordings of the original version of this book as a child. This is actually the 35th anniversary edition, which I rediscovered recently at the library. As I pour over this new version, I can hear all of the songs, stories and poems in my head read by the likes of Alan Alda, Marlo Thomas, Mel Brooks, Carol Channing, and other big names. This book is

Benjamin’s favourite things are:

2.Bouncing higher…


Benjamin is full of beans. He just never stops bouncing. But this story is about the time when his bounce got him a some very big bumps on the head…


Unique picture book talent, Rachel Bright, has created the wacky world of Woollybottom, a little town that sits on top of a very tall hill, and home to best friends, Walter and Winnie, and a whole host of other charming characters. Each book in the series gently and humorously addresses a ‘first experience’ that all young children will be able to relate to, in Rachel’s inimitable style"

His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid through tackling institutionalised racism, poverty and inequality, and fostering racial reconciliation. Politically an African nationalist and democratic socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) from 1991 to 1997. Internationally, Mandela was Secretary General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999.

was the last Governor-General of India. He also served as leader of the Indian National Congress, Premier of the Madras Presidency, Governor of West Bengal, Minister for Home Affairs of the Indian Union and Chief Minister of Madras state. Rajagopalachari founded the Swatantra Party and was one of the first recipients of India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna. He vehemently opposed the use of nuclear weapons and was a proponent of world peace and disarmament. During his lifetime, he also acquired the nickname 'Mango of Salem'.
was an Indian scholar and a senior political leader of the Indian independence movement. Following India's independence, he became the first Minister of Education in the Indian government. In 1992 he was posthumously awarded India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna.[1] There is also a theory which suggests that earlier when he was offered Bharat Ratna he promptly declined it saying that it should not be given to those who have been on the selection committee. Later he was awarded posthumously in 1992. He is commonly remembered as Maulana Azad; the word Maulana is an honorific meaning 'learned man', and he had adopted Azad (Free) as his pen name. His contribution to establishing the education foundation in India is recognised by celebrating his birthday as "National Education Day" across India

The earliest architectural relics date back to the Maurya Period (c. 300 BC); since then, the site has seen continuous settlement. In 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273-236 BC) was discovered near Srinivaspur. Two sandstone pillars inscribed with the edicts of Ashoka were brought to by Firuz Shah Tughluq in the 14th century. The famous Iron pillar near the Qutub Minar was commissioned by the emperor Kumara Gupta I of the Gupta dynasty (320-540) and transplant Delhi during the 10th century. Eight major cities have been situated in the Delhi area. The first five cities were in the southern part of present-day Delhi.

"Each structure is at least 10 m high and comprises a cantilever with an outstretched net suspended over the sea and large stones suspended from ropes as counterweights at the other end. Each installation is operated by a team of up to six fishermen. While such nets are used throughout coastal southern China and Indochina, in India they are mostly found in the Indian state of Kerala, where they have become a tourist attraction. The Indian common name arises because they are unusual in India and different from usual fishing nets in India.

The system is sufficiently balanced that the weight of a man walking along the main beam is sufficient to cause the net to descend into the sea. The net is left for a short time, possibly just a few minutes, before it is raised by pulling on ropes. The catch is usually modest: a few fish and crustaceans — these may be sold to passers by within minutes.

Rocks, each 30 cm or so in diameter are suspended from ropes of different lengths. As the net is raised, some of the rocks one-by-one come to rest on a platform thereby keeping everything in balance.

Each installation has a limited operating depth. Consequently, an individual net cannot be continually operated in tidal waters. Different installations will be operated depending on the state of the tide.

It was earlier thought that the nets might have been introduced by the Chinese explorer Zheng He.[2] Recent research shows that these were introduced by Portuguese Casado settlers from Macau[3]

The Chinese fishing nets have become a very popular tourist attraction, their size and elegant construction is photogenic and the slow rhythm of their operation is quite hypnotic. In addition, catches can be purchased individually and need be taken only a short distance to a street entrepreneur who will cook it."

Nice themes ..
I found this book on my placement whilst looking for "The bag of worries". This book was most definitely a good ‘stumble’! It’s about a creature called ‘Something Else’ who is excluded by all his creature friends for being different. He longs to join in but is excluded as he is ‘not like them’. This makes him very sad and upset. He suddenly gets a visit from another creature that is unlike him and at first; ‘something else’ is unpleasant to this creature because ‘he is not like him’. He turns this creature away but quickly realizes how unfriendly and cruel he is to him. He asks the creature to return and they begin to have fun and enjoy each other’s company. They quickly become friends. The wit of the author comes to light toward the end when another creature (a boy) is introduced. The question is will they be friendly with him too? The illustrations in the book are truly amazing and inspiring. Something Else is a truly thoughtful book which could initiate group discussions and conversations around how everyone is unique and special in their own way. I then chose this book to spark discussions around the ‘good to be me’ theme in a SEAL lesson. The children thoroughly engaged with this book and most definitely reminded children about inclusion. A thoroughly interesting read.

"Cooperatives include non-profit community organizations and businesses that are owned and managed by the people who use its services (a consumer cooperative) or by the people who work there (a worker cooperative) or by the people who live there (a housing cooperative), hybrids such as worker cooperatives that are also consumer cooperatives or credit unions, multi-stakeholder cooperatives such as those that bring together civil society and local actors to deliver community needs, and second and third tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives.

The International Co-operative Alliance was the first international association formed by the movement. It includes the World Council of Credit Unions. A second organization was formed later in Germany, the International Raiffeisen Union. In the United States, the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) serves as the sector's oldest national membership association. It is dedicated to ensuring that cooperative businesses have the same opportunities as other businesses operating in the country and that consumers have access to cooperatives in the marketplace. A U.S. National Cooperative Bank was formed in the 1970s. By 2004, a new association focused on worker co-ops was founded, the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives"

Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde was an Irish playwright, poet and author of numerous short stories and one novel. Known for his biting wit, and a plentitude of aphorisms, he became one of the most successful playwrights of the late Victorian era in London, and one of the greatest celebrities of his day. Several of his plays continue to be widely performed, especially The Importance of Being

In the beginning, windmills were utilized for taking out water and pounding grains. Running water and wind were applied for direction finding. Currently, some of the important and widely used non conventional sources of energy are tides, wind, solar geothermal heat, and biomass comprising animal waste, agricultural waste, and human body waste. For example, disposals from big metropolitan areas can work as a source of producing biogas. All these non conventional energy sources are unlimited or restorable and are essentially quite economical

"Books have their own special resonance in the portion of our brain that holds Nostalgia. Those stories of our youth, when the life-long joys of reading were just begin to flourish, are often some of the most special. Those of us fortunate enough to have cut our teeth on Arnold Lobel’s Frog and Toad series have experienced all of the great things of reading twice: the first is when we read these touching, funny and beautiful books that detail the wonderful parts of friendship; the second is recalling fondly those moments spent in Frog and Toad’s world – whether revisiting that world accessing Nostalgia or reading the stories to your children, grandchildren and seeing Frog and Toad anew through their eyes.

The Contemporary Jewish Museum here in San Francisco has hosted an exhibit on Arnold Lobel for the past few months – it closes this weekend, so today my wife, daughter and I paid a visit to the exhibit. 11:00 am on a Thursday is the right time to visit a museum; we had the entire Lobel exhibit mostly to ourselves. The Frog and Toad series was the centerpiece and included original ink drawings, notebooks of scrawled pictures and story ideas. There were finger puppets from the Mouse Soup book series for kids to enjoy, drawing tables and stacks of Lobel books. The exhibit was geared towards children, as it should be. Lobel states that he knew as a child that he was destined to write children’s books. It shows in everything he created.

If you have enjoyed the Frog and Toad series, and are reading this, I hope that the recollection of those friends brings a smile to your face. If you haven’t read them yet, now is the perfect time."

Magnets are used all over the world in almost all modern devices from computer hard drives to the latest environmentally friendly cars and transportation. With so much information available on the internet we have provided a basic introductory guide to magnets & magnetic fields. A Magnet is a material which produces an invisible magnetic field which can attract ferromagnetic materials. Magnets can also attract or repel other Magnets. All Magnets have at least 2 magnetic poles.

"and Medicine. Our topic was whether income inequality is a health risk to people who live in particularly unequal cities or states. The idea is that income inequality is like a toxic pollution, harming everyone who lives with it. My own view, then and now, is that there is no such effect, though I also believe that the extreme income inequality that we see in the U.S. today is a threat to public health, but through quite different (essentially political) mechanisms. - See more at: http://healthblog.ncpa.org/does-inequality-cause-poor-health/#sthash.rqMwSg62.dpuf

"Every second plan I hear these days is Ladakh. Every second travel query I get is about Ladakh. There are two kinds of people in my world - Those who have visited Ladakh and those who haven’t. So I guess it only makes sense to write this post now better than later because it is Ladakh Season this summer!The next time you hear Guns & Roses sing “She’s got the eyes of the bluest skies”, it is this blue that will come to your mind once you’ve seen the amazingly clear skies of Ladakh. I usually do this kind of post at the end of the series, but I am hoping this post is going to drive me in the coming days to finish the series and maybe help you in planning your itinerary. Also please note that I would still like to see Ladakh as the remote land of mountains and it's seeming inaccessibility and lack of commercialization is what makes it so special. I hope you do not go there looking for citylife luxuries, coz if you do there will be someone who is listening to you. And soon Ladakh will be another Kerala. 

The northernmost state of Jammu & Kashmir consists of three main regions – Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. The three different regions have three distinct geological and cultural features. Jammu is the major city in the Jammu region, Srinagar, the capital city of the state is situated in Kashmir region and Leh being the largest settlement in Ladakh region. As you go into the arid lands of Ladakh from the lush valleys of Kashmir, one cannot help but struggle to find relation between the lands just left behind to the lands he just entered"
"I love teaching science!  This week my third graders are working on magnetic fields and temporary magnets.  Temporary magnets make a low budget and easy experiment that just amazes the students. 
First, I put the following vocabulary words on the board so that we can reference them throughout the lesson.  I like to be able to point to the word as I'm saying it to catch those visual learners.  :)
temporary magnet, permanent magnet, stroke, pole, nail, magnetize
Second, I show them this picture:"
"A magnet is a material or object that produces an invisible magnetic field which can attract to ferromagnetic materials"
Magnets are objects that produce an area of magnetic force called a magnetic field.

"Relationships are powerful. Our one-to-one connections with each other are the foundation for change. And building relationships with people from different cultures, often many different cultures, is key in building diverse communities that are powerful enough to achieve significant goals.

Whether you want to make sure your children get a good education, bring quality health care into your communities, or promote economic development, there is a good chance you will need to work with people from several different racial, language, ethnic, or economic groups. And in order to work with people from different cultural groups effectively, you will need to build sturdy and caring relationships based on trust, understanding, and shared goals.

Why? Because trusting relationships are the glue that hold people together as they work on a common problem. As people work on challenging problems, they will have to hang in there together when things get hard. They will have to support each other to stay with an effort, even when it feels discouraging. People will have to resist the efforts of those who use divide-and-conquer techniques--pitting one cultural group against another.

Whether you are Vietnamese, African American, Caucasian Protestant, Irish Catholic, Jewish, or from any other racial, ethnic, religious, or socioeconomic group, you will probably need to establish relationships with people whose group you may know very little about.

Each one of us is like a hub of a wheel. Each one of us can build relationships and friendships around ourselves that provide us with the necessary strength to achieve community goals. If each person builds a network of diverse and strong relationships, we can come together and solve problems that we have in common.

In this section, we are going to talk about:

Becoming aware of your own culture as a first step in learning about other people's culture.
Building relationships with people from many different cultures.
But first let's talk about what culture is. Culture is a complex concept, with many different definitions. But, simply put, ""culture"" refers to a group or community with which we share common experiences that shape the way we understand the world. It includes groups that we are born into, such as gender, race, national origin, class, or religion. It can also include groups we join or become part of. For example, we can acquire a new culture by moving to a new region, by a change in our economic status, or by becoming disabled. When we think of culture this broadly we realize we all belong to many cultures at once. Do you agree? How might this apply to you?"

"One of the best resources for introducing children to different cultures around the globe, this book was written by Anabel and Barnabas Kindersley in association with UNICEF. Each one or two page spread shows a closeup picture of a real child, and clear photographs illustrate his or her family, house, favorite foods and what they like to play with. My child immediately loved Celina, a Tembe Indian from Brazil who wears no shirt , but her chest is decorated with red paint, and she sleeps in a hammock and bathes in a river. Other children portrayed are Rachel, who lives in a French chateau, Meena, who lives on a construction site in India, and Suchart, a Thai monk. The book encourages children to see children in other parts of the world, no matter how humble their possessions, as beautiful and important individuals. The only possible danger from reading this book is that, because there is only one child from most countries, some children might assume that all Brazilians look like Celina. Aside from that possibility, however, I think this book excites curiosity and appreciation of the world's diverse cultures. The ALA voted this book a Notable/Best book of 1996.

A Horn Book review from March, 1996 mentions helpfully that the magazine-like format of the book encourages browsing and will provide children with insight about other cultures. A School Library Journal review from January, 1996 goes into more detail about how the book is organized, i.e. that it is divided by continent and contains a supplemental section in the form of a travel diary by the authors. Both reviews summarize what the book contains and agree that the book would be enlightening for children to read."

Begin the activity by having students brainstorm (view literacy strategy descriptions) a list of things they need to survive.  Students should share their list and through discussion of what we cannot live without, narrow the list down to air, water, food, and shelter.  Have students brainstorm a list of things plants need to survive.  Have students share their list and discuss the basic needs of plants.   Help students remember the needs of plants with this acronym (LAWNS – Light, Air, Water, Nutrients, Space).  Students should compare and contrast the needs of plants and animals through class discussion.

Did you know that the first refrigerator magnet patent was obtained by William Zimmerman of St. Louis, Missouri, only in the early 1970s’ [1] Zimmerman patented the idea of small, colored, cartoon magnets to be used for decorative display and convenience. Not so much time ago, nobody even knew such thing, and now it can be found in everyone’s home!

I like writing and editing because every project is different – with CD-ROMs, I particularly enjoy the challenge of working with multi-media. Although I’ve written loads of books, I still get excited when the first copies of a new series arrive!

Since 26 January 1930, it was the day on which thousands of people, in villages, in mohallas, in towns, in small and big groups would take the independence pledge, committing themselves to the complete independence of India from British rule. It was only fitting that the new republic should come into being on that day, marking from its very inception the continuity between the struggle for independence and the adoption of the Constitution that made India a Republic.

Very important information
"Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III. Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died in 1820, and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She inherited the throne at the age of 18, after her father's three elder brothers had all died, leaving no legitimate, surviving children. The United Kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy, in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power. Privately, Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments. Publicly, she became a national icon, and was identified with strict standards of personal morality.

Victoria married her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in 1840. Their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent, tying them together and earning her the nickname ""the grandmother of Europe"". After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, republicanism temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. Her Golden and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration.

Her reign of 63 years and seven months, which is longer than that of any other British monarch and the longest of any female monarch in history, is known as the Victorian era. It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover. Her son and successor, Edward VII, belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the line of his father."
"George was a grandson of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and the first cousin of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. From 1877 to 1891, he served in the Royal Navy. On the death of Victoria in 1901, George's father became King Edward VII, and George was made Prince of Wales. On his father's death in 1910, he succeeded as King-Emperor of the British Empire. He was the only Emperor of India to be present at his own Delhi Durbar.

As a result of the First World War (1914–18), most other European empires fell while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the House of Windsor, which he renamed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as a result of anti-German public sentiment. His reign saw the rise of socialism, communism, fascism, Irish republicanism, and the Indian independence movement, all of which radically changed the political landscape. The Parliament Act 1911 established the supremacy of the elected British House of Commons over the unelected House of Lords. In 1924 he appointed the first Labour ministry and in 1931 the Statute of Westminster recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate, independent states within the Commonwealth of Nations. He was plagued by illness throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward VIII."

He has been referred to as "the greatest British architect"[1] and is known best for having an instrumental role in designing and building a section of the metropolis of Delhi, known as New Delhi, which would later on serve as the seat of the Government of India.[2] In recognition of his contribution, New Delhi is also known as "Lutyens' Delhi". In collaboration with Sir Herbert Baker, he was also the main architect of several monuments in New Delhi such as the India Gate; he also designed Viceroy's House, which is now known as the Rashtrapati Bhavan.
He was one of the principal poets of the Delhi School of the Urdu ghazal and remains arguably the foremost name in Urdu poetry often remembered as Xudā-e suxan (god of poetry).

"Born Prince Khurram, he was the son of Emperor Jahangir and his Hindu Rajput wife, Taj Bibi Bilqis Makani (13 May 1573 – 18 April 1619). While young, Khurram was the favourite of his legendary grandfather, the third Mughal emperor Akbar.

He was chosen as successor to the throne after the death of his father in 1627. He was considered one of the greatest Mughals. His rule has been called the Golden Age and one of the most prosperous ages of Indian civilization. Like Akbar, he was eager to expand his vast empire. In 1658, he fell ill and was confined by his son Aurangzeb in Agra Fort until his death in 1666.

Unlike his father and his grandfather, Shah Jahan was a pious Muslim. Upon his accession, he adopted new policies which steadfastly reversed Akbar's generally liberal treatment of non-Muslims. In 1633, his sixth regnal year, Shah Jahan began to impose Sharia provisions against construction or repair of churches and temples and subsequently ordered the demolitions of newly built Hindu temples. He celebrated Islamic festivals with great pomp and grandeur and with an enthusiasm unfamiliar to his predecessors. Long-dormant royal interest in the Holy Cities also revived during his reign.[2]

The period of his reign was the golden age of Mughal architecture. Shah Jahan erected many splendid monuments, the most famous of which is the Taj Mahal at Agra, built in 1632–1654 as a tomb for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal.


The Moti Masjid, Agra and many other buildings in Agra, the Red Fort and the Jama Masjid in Delhi, mosques in Lahore, extensions to Lahore Fort and a mosque in Thatta also commemorate him. The fabled Peacock Throne, said to be worth millions of dollars by modern estimates, also dates from his reign. He was also the founder of the new imperial capital called Shahjahanabad, now known as Old Delhi. Other important buildings of Shah Jahan's rule were the Diwan-i-Am and Diwan-i-Khas in the Red Fort Complex in Delhi and the Moti Masjid in the Lahore Fort. Shah Jahan is also believed to have had a very refined taste in the arts and architecture, and is credited with having commissioned about 999 gardens in Kashmir, his favorite summer residence. A few of these gardens survive, attracting millions of tourists every year.[citation needed]"
Early civilizations in Burma included the Tibeto-Burman speaking Pyu in Upper Burma and the Mon in Lower Burma.[12] In the 9th century, the Burmans of the Kingdom of Nanzhao entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and, following the establishment of the Pagan Empire in the 1050s, the Burmese language and culture slowly became dominant in the country. During this period, Theravada Buddhism gradually became the predominant religion of the country. The Pagan Empire fell due to the Mongol invasions (1277–1301), and several warring states emerged. In the second half of the 16th century, reunified by the Taungoo Dynasty, the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia.[13] The early 19th century Konbaung Dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Burma and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well. The British conquered Burma after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country became a British colony (a part of India until 1937 and then a separately administered colony). Burma became an independent nation in 1948, initially as a democratic nation and then, following a coup in 1962, a military dictatorship which formally ended in 2011.
Although situated a mere 15 km from Mysore city, Srirangapattana lies in the neighbouring district of Mandya. The entire town is enclosed by the river Kaveri to form a river island, northern half of which is shown in the image to the right. While the main river flows on the eastern side of the island, the Paschima Vaahini segment of the same river flows to its west. The town is easily accessible by train from Bangalore and Mysore and is also well-connected by road, lying as it does just off the Bangalore-Mysore highway. The highway passes through this town and special care was taken to minimize any impact on the monuments.

Located on the east bank of the Hooghly river, it is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational centre of East India, while the Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port as well as its sole major riverine port. As of 2011, the city had 4.5 million residents; the urban agglomeration, which comprises the city and its suburbs, was home to approximately 14.1 million, making it the third-most populous metropolitan area in India. As of 2008, its economic output as measured by gross domestic product ranked third among South Asian cities, behind Mumbai and Delhi.[6] As a growing metropolitan city in a developing country, Kolkata confronts substantial urban pollution, traffic congestion, poverty, overpopulation, and other logistic and socioeconomic problems

This is the perfect read when visiting Delhi.
During British rule, the city was their first trading settlement on the Bay of Bengal coast, when it was also known as Masulipatnam or Masula, and as Bandar in folklore.[1] It is located at a distance of 72 km (45 mi) to the east of Vijayawada.

An absolute necessity in every Pakistanis bag when going to Delhi
It is the third largest city in Tamil Nadu.[3] Located on the banks of River Vaigai, it has been a major settlement for two millennia and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.[4][5]
I have readed about this
everyday or a narrow strip of stream tells a story of ancient times. Centuries of history coexist with metro stations and plush cars. The readings in this book give us glimpses of the lives of people who lived in the Delhi area over the centuries, and how these details have been pieced together by historians. It brings into focus the importance of the historian s method and the sources of information found in ancient texts, archaeology and even legends and folklore, sometimes hanging on the thread of a slender historical fact. The editor of the volume, points to the urgency of further exploration and documentation to fill in the still all-too-meagre details of Delhi s ancient history. However, she ends on a note of caution, bordering on alarm, when she points out that invaluable evidence of the city s past is being extensively destroyed due to quarrying and the construction of new roads and buildings. Such activities are an integral part of the modernization of a living city but the balance between modernization and the preservation of ancient remains is indeed very fragile and needs to be maintained from an informed and realistic perspective. This collection of essays has been put together by a teacher for students of history, but will also be of enormous value to a large number of other interested readers.

The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the appellation of a small manorial borough, in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. Then, during the Industrial Revolution, Leeds developed into a major mill town; wool was the dominant industry but flax, engineering, iron foundries, printing, and other industries were important.[6] From being a compact market town in the valley of the River Aire in the 16th century Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century

intercast marriages are of great use to society, different people and families are bind and people learn different culture
government should support the couples who are of diffrenent cast and should protect them
In India their is a difference between the gender equality since decades, and the same still continues in some part of the country, which is very shameful.
gender equality is very important and prime factor for any country to grow.
Excellent ideas

his empire was the Maratha empire. The foundation stone of this empire was basically laid by Shivaji in the late-seventeenth century. After his death the power passed on to his immediate successors who were his son and subsequently his grandson Shahuji. Later on Shahuji confided power to a Brahmin Bhat family, and thus started the order of Peshwa (a royal title).

Interesting book
NCERT book is the best knowledge of student
"This book seems to be in a series of “Tree Tales” books. I’ve already read one of the other three, and have the remaining two books on my to-read shelf.

This is an excellent nature book. I learned so much. I had no idea how much life a cactus can support, from birth until after death.

The book covers the lifespan of the saguaro cactus and how throughout its life it nourishes all sorts of creatures, including humans. This account is not at all dry but fascinating. There is so much detail and the illustrations add immeasurably to the information. They’re wonderful. I love seeing all the creatures involved and also seeing just how slowly this cactus grows. The whole ecosystem is amazing.

I’ll have to get to those other 2 books!

This is a book best enjoyed by independent readers. There is just too much information, in text and pictures, to have to rely on being only a listener/viewer. Kids who are interested in desert life, trees, cacti, ecosystems, Native peoples, sweet treats, and nature are likely to enjoy this book"

no photosynthesis no food no life on earth
as they convert the atmospheric nitrogen to nitrates as the plants can not absorb nitrogen but they can take nitrates from the soil
because the animals directly or indirectly take food from plants
if there was no grass there would be no grass eating animal left so lion  would not have anything for his hunger eventually he would die
Very interesting.

I disagree as all animals are not edible because some have spikes on them, they are poisonous or they don't have much muscle inside them to eat. Plants are not edible as some are poisonous and some like Fern have no edible organ. There are many more reasons for plants and animals to not to be edible
yes I agree because many are beggar
no herbivores are animal who eat green plants
yes they are edible

Timely, relevant, and accurate information is crucial to farmers. Policymakers in developing countries also need good data to inform their decision making. We support data collection, research, and policy analysis to help evaluate the impact of various approaches, get accurate information to farmers, and assess the effects of national and international agricultural policies. Our research also includes measuring the progress of our grants to ensure that they are delivering the anticipated benefits to farming families.

Food is made up of nutrients. Micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals are needed only in small amounts. Macronutrients such as carbohydrates, protein and fat are needed in larger amounts. The body cannot function properly if one or more nutrients are missing. A healthy and balanced diet provides foods in the right amounts and combinations that are safe and free from disease and harmful substances.
Even in modern days in India caste system is still occurring.

Indian sepoy to at least as far back as the 15th century, firmly rooting him in India's medieval past.

Amazing chapter.
The doctrine of subsidiary alliance was introduced by Lord Wellesley, British Governor-General in India from 1798 to 1805. Early in his governorship Wellesley adopted a policy of non-intervention in the princely states, but he later adopted the policy of forming subsidiary alliances. This policy was to play a major role in British expansion in India. According to the term of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed force . They were to be protected by the company, but had to pay for the 'subsidiary forces' that the company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty.For example,the ruler of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the company in 1801,as he failed to pay for the "subsidiary forces".Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds. By the late 18th century, power of the Maratha Empire had weakened in the Indian subcontinent, and India was left with a great number of states, most small and weak. Many rulers accepted the offer of protection by Lord Wellesley, as it gave them security against attack by their neighbors.

At the time of its adoption, the British East India Company had imperial administrative jurisdiction over wide regions of the subcontinent. The company took over the princely states of Satara (1848), Jaitpur and Sambalpur (1849), Nagpur and Jhansi (1854),
Doctrine of lapse was the policy of Dalhousie, the then Governor General, to annexed the independent Indian States in 1848 A.D. This doctrine was based on the idea that in case a ruler of dependent state died childless, the right of ruling over the State reverted or ‘lapsed’ to the sovereign.

Europe is the world's second-smallest continent
he writes beautifully
"In 1833, by the Government of India Act of that year, the Governors-General of Bengal were re designated as Governors-General of India.

In 1858 the term Viceroy of India was added to the office, but this title was abandoned in 1947 when India and Pakistan gained their independence. The office of Governor-General continued to exist in each of the new dominions until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956 respectively."

The first battle (April 21, 1526) was between the Mughal chief Bābur, then ruler of Kabul, and Sultan Ibrāhīm Lodī of Delhi. Although the sultan’s army outnumbered the Mughals’, it was unused to the wheeling tactics of the cavalry and suffered from deep divisions. Ibrāhīm was killed, and his army was defeated. This marked the beginning of the Mughal Empire in India.
The satraps he established in the north west of the subcontinent quickly crumbled after he left. Later, trade was carried between Indian states and the Roman Empire by Roman sailors who reached India via the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, but the Romans never sought trading settlements or territory in India. The spice trade between India and Europe was one of the main types of trade in the world economy and was the main catalyst for the period of European exploration.[1][2] The search for the wealth and prosperity of India led to the accidental "discovery" of the Americas by Christopher Columbus in 1492. Only a few years later, near the end of the 15th century, Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama became the first European to re-establish direct trade links with India since Roman times by being the first to arrive by circumnavigating Africa (1497–1499). Having arrived in Calicut, which by then was one of the major trading ports of the eastern world,[3] he obtained permission to trade in the city from Saamoothiri Rajah.
non living things are of great help to living things
After the mid-18th century the cotton-goods trade declined, while tea became an important import from China. Beginning in the early 19th century, the company financed the tea trade with illegal opium exports to China. Chinese opposition to this trade precipitated the first Opium War (1839–42), which resulted in a Chinese defeat and the expansion of British trading privileges; a second conflict, often called the Arrow War (1856–60), brought increased trading rights for Europeans.

The battle established the Company rule in Bengal which expanded over much of India for the next hundred years. The battle took place at Plassey (anglicized version of Palashi) on the banks of the Bhagirathi River, about 150 km north of Calcutta and south of Murshidabad, then capital of Bengal (now in Nadia district in West Bengal). The belligerents were Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, and the British East India Company. When Alivardhi Khan died in 1756, Siraj-ud-daulah became the nawab of Bengal. He ordered the English to stop the extension of their fortification. Robert Clive bribed Mir Jafar, the commander in chief of the nawab's army, and attacked Calcutta. He defeated the Nawab at Plassey in 1757 and captured Calcutta.

Partly correct
Anglo-Indian, and Bengali children s literature respond to five key historical events: the missionary debates preceding the Charter Act of 1813, the defeat of Tipu Sultan, the Mutiny of 1857, the birth of Indian nationalism, and the Swadeshi movement resulting from the Partition of Bengal in 1905. Through a study of works by Mary Sherwood (1775-1851), Barbara Hofland (1770-1844), Sara Jeanette Duncan (1861-1922), Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936), Upendrakishore Ray (1863-1915), and Sukumar Ray (1887-1923), Goswami examines how children s literature negotiates and represents these momentous historical forces that unsettled Britain s imperial ambitions in India.

"you’re ready are uniquely revealed through words and drawings as Greg records them in his diary.

In book one of this debut series, Greg is happy to have Rowley, his sidekick, along for the ride. But when Rowley’s star starts to rise, Greg tries to use his best friend’s newfound popularity to his own advantage, kicking off a chain of events that will test their friendship in hilarious fashion.

Author/illustrator Jeff Kinney recalls the growing pains of school life and introduces a new kind of hero who epitomizes the challenges of being a kid. As Greg says in his diary, “Just don’t expect me to be all ‘Dear Diary’ this and ‘Dear Diary’ that.” Luckily for us, what Greg Heffley says he won’t do and what he actually does are two very different things.

Since its launch in May 2004 on Funbrain.com, the Web version of Diary of a Wimpy Kid has been viewed by 20 million unique online readers. This year, it is averaging 70,000 readers a day"

the colonial regime; they also emphasize the centrality of Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan in Indian nationalist historiography. This collection is of particular importance, especially in light of the recent tendency to devalue the significance of the two rulers.
I like this book very much
India's rise from commercial enclave to great Empire, from Clive's victory of Plassey, through the imperial wars of the eighteenth century and the Afghan and Sikh Wars of the 1840s, through the bloody turmoil of the Mutiny, and the frontier campaigns at the century's end. With its focus on the experience of ordinary soldiers, "Sahib" explains to us why soldiers of the Raj had joined the army, how they got to India and what they made of it when they arrived. The book examines Indian soldiering in peace and war, from Kipling's 'snoring barrack room' to storming parties assaulting mighty fortresses, cavalry swirling across open plains, and khaki columns inching their way between louring hills. Making full use of extensive and often neglected archive material in the India Office Library and National Army Museum, "Sahib" does for the British soldier in India - whether serving a local ruler, forming part of the Indian army, or soldiering with a British regiment - what "Tommy" did for the ordinary soldier in the First World War

In this fascinating portrait, Margaret MacMillan examines the hidden lives of the women who supported their husbands’ conquests–and in turn supported the Raj, often behind the scenes and out of the history books. Enduring heartbreaking separations from their families, these women had no choice but to adapt to their strange new home, where they were treated with incredible deference by the natives but found little that was familiar.

hi, parth  agriculture is the cultivation of animals, plants, fungi, and other life forms for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinals and other products used to sustain and enhance human life.
it is wonderful art by Shah Jahan  and is also the pride of India. it also has a same copy of bibi ka maqbara in Auranabad
it was built in 22 years . first there were no calendars so the ears were counted making the tomb at the gate . when it was ready
first Mumtaz  Mahels kabar was kept and when Shah Jahan was killed y his son Aurangzeb then his kabar was also kept beside Mumtaz's kabar . Taj mahal has fake kubars at the top the real kabars are 200 feet down.
we can see real kabars only thrice a year on special days and  only those person can only see who are having no problem in lungs or chest like asthama as they would not be able to breathe 200 feet down.

AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE STORY
this sentence is disagree for me also because they do not have money so they do work  .
no, they did not have money so they are working
No children who work does not enjoy greater freedom as they have to work day and night for money.Plus they are not educated so they will not get job and they will not get enough money to survive so they will die faster
Children in future will become the back bone of our country. So I feel that they should be rightly educated rather than working. It isn't true that working children enjoy greater freedom, in addition they are forced to do the work. If they are educated, in future they will have enough money to survive. Working children are not pleased with their life and want freedom and happiness by learning and exploring.
no,science is not always good some times it could be harmful to us and our nature
both are but in different ways
no, school going kids are smarter than the children who works because nowadays study is very important. i disagree.
no , the children who are working are not smarter than school kids because they are working all time and can' t study .  so i dis agree .
no,scolding children is not good if you scold them parent's & teachers worst action the child can see and would be afraid of parents and teachers and in 25% of cases children  do suieside in  boarding schools , hostel and some times also in collages.
